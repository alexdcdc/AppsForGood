There were just 12 minutes left of a low-key encounter when the midfielder cut inside and curled an excellent shot past the hand of Dan Hanford.
Dennis then added a second late on with a deft dink over the keeper, thanks in part to a through ball by academy prospect Aiden Enver who was making his senior debut.
There was a lack of intensity throughout, with neither side having anything more than pride to play for on the final day.
Dennis's intervention helped the London outfit consolidate another excellent season in mid-table.
