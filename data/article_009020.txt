Glyndwr University bought the ground and fans group Wrexham Supporters' Trust took over the club when it got into difficulties in 2011.
The trust board signed a deal to take on the lease after fans gave their backing in a vote in March.
The Racecourse ground has been the club's home for most of its 152 year history.
An open day was held on Monday, when the deal was confirmed.
Club director Spencer Harris said: "It's a tremendous day in the history of Wrexham football club with the fans taking over effective ownership of the Racecourse ground."
He said the stadium has been a loss-making facility over the years so new projects were being launched in a bid to reverse its fortunes - such as using it as a live music venue following the success of Stereophonics' gig in July.
As part of the open day, Wrexham manager Gary Mills and players held a question and answer session at the stadium's Centenary Club.
