Linfield's encounter with Lurgan Celtic was scheduled for Friday, 1 April but it will now take place a day later.
The Friday night slot is now filled by the meeting between Premiership leaders Crusaders and Glenavon.
The reasons for the request include "potential public disorder, raised community tension and other events in the city on the evening of 1 April."
"After careful consideration the Challenge Cup Committee of the Irish FA has agreed to the formal request," said the IFA on Wednesday.
Lurgan Celtic provided a major upset in the quarter-finals with a 3-2 victory over Portadown at Shamrock Park.
