The train was suspended last week after two incidents in which passenger doors opened mid-journey.
The refurbished trains are due to run on the Belfast to Dublin route from the end of February.
Translink said that the suspension has been lifted after an investigation of the door mechanisms.
"We would strongly reassure our passengers and the wider public that there was no imminent danger for our customers travelling on board as a result of these two unrelated door faults," said Ian Campbell, general manager of engineering at Translink.
"We have worked closely with the Railway Safety Commission (RSC) and, having satisfied their concerns, the upgraded train will now be returned into service this afternoon (Wednesday 13 January)."
Translink has previously described the refurbished trains as a "major milestone" in its Â£12.2m NI railways upgrade programme.
