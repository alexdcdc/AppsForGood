Goals from Jabo Ibehre, Jason Kennedy and Luke Joyce settled the issue before the interval and although Crawley tried to fight back in the second half, Enzio Boldewijn grabbing a late goal, the outcome was never in doubt as the Cumbrians consolidated second place in League Two.
Carlisle soon looked threatening and it took Ibehre just five minutes to head them in front from six yards after the Crawley defence failed to deal with Tom Miller's long throw from the right.
The hosts went further ahead in the 28th minute courtesy of Kennedy's seventh goal of the season. The midfield man was on hand to hook the ball home from close in after Michael Raynes had headed a ball from Mike Jones back across the six-yard box.
Joyce made it 3-0 on the stroke of half time with the best of Carlisle's goals, a 30-yard screamer which left Glenn Morris beaten all ends up as it flew into the top left corner.
It was a better second-half effort from Crawley, although substitute Jamie Devitt went close to adding to Carlisle's tally with a dipping 20 yarder that Morris was glad to shuffle away for a corner.
Crawley scored a consolation goal in added time when Boldewijn whipped home a low shot from a tight angle.
