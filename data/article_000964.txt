The new timetable will run from 5 - 29 August with the last trams leaving Princes Street at 23:32 from Sunday to Friday and 00:39 on Saturday nights.
The late-night departures from the city centre will run to Edinburgh Airport, including Ingliston park and ride.
Although bikes can normally be taken on trams, they are banned during the festival.
George Lowder, Transport for Edinburgh chief executive, said: "The success of Edinburgh's festivals is important to the economic growth and prosperity of Edinburgh and Scotland's tourism market.
"With so many additional visitors coming to the capital in August, we are keen to help passengers travel safely around the city by offering a late-night timetable that suits their plans.
"This service will be a great addition to the city's festival programme and we expect thousands of locals and tourists to make use of the additional trams to travel to and from venues."
