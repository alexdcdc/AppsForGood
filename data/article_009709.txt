Taylor's 7-4 loss at Birmingham's Barclaycard Arena was followed by an impressive 7-1 win for world number one Van Gerwen over James Wade.
Four players - Gary Anderson, Adrian Lewis, Wade and Wright - can still claim one of the remaining two spots.
Anderson needs one point from his final two games to qualify for the last four.
A win over Wright would have booked the defending champion's place in London on 19 May, but he was held to a 6-6 draw by Wright.
Lewis is three points clear of fifth-placed Wade and requires one more win to seal a play-off place following his 7-2 success against Robert Thornton, while Anderson's 7-5 defeat of Raymond van Barneveld ended the Dutchman's hopes of qualification.
Peter Wright 7-4 Phil Taylor
Raymond van Barneveld 5-7 Gary Anderson
Adrian Lewis 7-2 Robert Thornton
James Wade 1-7 Michael van Gerwen
Peter Wright 6-6 Gary Anderson
