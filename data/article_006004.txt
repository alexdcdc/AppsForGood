Kieran Phillips appeared at Perth Sheriff Court after an incident which saw armed police called to a hostel in Perth city centre on Thursday.
The 19-year-old is charged with assaulting seven named officers by throwing items including a fridge and a sink out of a window at them.
He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody.
Mr Phillips is alleged to have shown "utter disregard for the safety of the public" by smashing a window at Greyfriars Hostel and showering the street below with glass. That charge alleges he threw broken sink parts, glass and a fridge out of the window.
He is further alleged to have destroyed furniture by smashing a sink and causing flooding to his room and the rooms below, as well as destroying electrical fittings.
The teenager also faces a charge of breaching the peace by shouting, swearing and threatening people including himself, and a further allegation of ripping an electric cable from a CCTV camera at Perth Police station.
Sheriff David Young continued the case for further examination.
