Rafiullah Hamidy, 24, was being sought in connection with a rape in the Northwood Road area of Ramsgate last September.
He was arrested by local police in Taranto, southern Italy, after Kent officers secured a European Arrest Warrant.
Mr Hamidy is due to appear in an Italian court to face an extradition hearing, the force said.
