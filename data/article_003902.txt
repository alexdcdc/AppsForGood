"At the moment there are still a lot of people who want to turn up," he told Grimmy on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show.
It's already been on the air for a decade, and with Simon returning to the judging line-up, it seems like there's still some life in The X Factor yet.
But what about in another 10 years? Or 20? Or more?
Simon seems to think it could go on indefinitely, so long as they keep finding great contestants.
So basically it's down to you. If you want The X Factor to remain on our screens for the rest of our lives, then keep turning up to those auditions.
And if you don't? Then send your boring mates.
"You've got to find great people and if they're all boring then it will run out of steam and then you may have to rest it and then bring it back," he said in his BBC interview.
So actually there's no way of stopping the juggernaut, a break is the most you're going to get.
Simon's also got a bigger pool of people to choose from, now that younger teenagers are allowed to audition.
"A lot of the really great kids now are 14, 15 years old and they probably know a lot more than the older contestants," he said.
"It's case by case. If they're really nervous or you've got some horrible stage mum pushing them on to the show, forget it.
"I would have done it. I would have been in a band in a shot."
In his interview with Nick Grimshaw, Simon also shared his critique of recent television series.
He and his girlfriend Lauren Silverman are fans of House of Cards, which surprised him to begin with.
"Normally when everyone tells me about how it is great, it's usually terrible, like those weirdo Game of Throne things, which I couldn't be bothered with," he said.
