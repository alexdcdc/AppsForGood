Exeter make three changes from last Saturday's thrilling 35-35 draw with leaders Wasps.
Geoff Parling replaces the suspended Jonny Hill in the second row, while tight-head prop Harry Williams and hooker Jack Yeandle also start.
Worcester lock forward Will Spencer will be up against two former team-mates, Exeter backs Olly Woodburn and Ollie Devoto, who both played alongside him at Bath under Gary Gold, now Warriors director of rugby.
Exeter have the best away record in the Premiership, having picked up 22 points from seven outings this season, and have won all nine previous Premiership meetings between the two sides. Worcester's most recent success over Exeter came at the old County Ground in Division One in March 2004.
