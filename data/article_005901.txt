Niamh Curry, from Wellingborough, died in 2012, days after her family raised most of the £365,000 needed for treatment in the US.
Parents Sam and Chris Curry donated that money to charity and have since raised a further £250,000.
"We've had so much support from so many people," said Mr Curry.
Niamh was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a form of aggressive childhood cancer which attacks the sympathetic nervous system, in 2010 when she was three.
She underwent several bouts of medication, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and an operation to remove a tumour, but the cancer returned at the end of 2011. She lost her fight against the disease in 2012.
But her parents pledged to continue raising money for research into the disease and set up the Niamh's Next Step charity, with many fundraising events and sponsored activities.
Mr Curry said since losing their daughter he and his wife had been "called" into raising money in her memory, to help research into neuroblastoma.
"We would have loved not to have gone through what we went through, and we would love to still have her around, even from that terrible situation it would have been wrong to walk away," he said.
