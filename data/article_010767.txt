A prom proposal in western Colorado could land the unknown suitor in hot water. 
  
 Graffiti was spray painted on rocks at the Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction. The messages said, “I promise to love you Forever + Always,” “You’re perfect to me” and “PROM….ISE?” 
  
 Monument officials are seeking information about the vandalism. Officials posted pictures of the graffiti on Facebook on Saturday, asking anyone with information to call the visitor center at 970-858-3617 ext. 360. 
  
 According to an article from The Daily Sentinel, Park rangers also found a rock spray-painted with “WCO” underlined in black. The vandal could face up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine, the Sentinel reported. ||||| Story highlights The offense is punishable by up to six months in prison 
  
 The National Park Service is seeking tips to find the culprit 
  
 (CNN) It's not often a "promposal" can lead to prison, but that could be the result of a proposal made using the Colorado National Monument. 
  
 An invitation to prom and two other comments were found spray-painted onto the side of the monument in late May by a person who lives near the monument. The vandalism could be punishable by three to six months in prison and a fine of up to $500. 
  
 A Saturday post on the monument's Facebook page seeks tips on who sprayed the graffiti. 
  
 Ranger Frank Hayde, a representative for the monument, said, "We've actually had some pretty decent success in solving these cases. Obviously, not all these cases can be solved, but sometimes through tips and other means we're able to do so." 
  
 The hope is that the perpetrator will come forward on their own, he said.
