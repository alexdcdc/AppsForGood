 Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke." ||||| About “Swish Swish” 
  
 “Swish Swish” is the third single from Katy Perry’s fifth studio album, Witness and marks the first song featuring vocals from both Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj. It is a self-empowerment anthem that calls out haters. Katy has mentioned that her album is about a “360° liberation” and this song is about escaping pointless negativity. The central hook uses the image of a basketball player consistently scoring points, imitating the ‘swish’ sound of the hoop’s net. 
  
 Fans speculated the song to be a response to Taylor Swift’s 2014 hit “Bad Blood,” citing many lyrical references. 
  
 This was later confirmed when she starred in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke interview. Katy explained: 
  
 She started it and it’s time for her to finish it. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, there’s going to be a reaction, and trust me, daddy, there’s going to be a reaction. 
  
 The song was indirectly confirmed days prior by EDM artist and ex-Taylor flame Calvin Harris, who said he “wasn’t involved” in a now-deleted tweet. ||||| On Monday night, as promised, James Corden delivered a new Carpool Karaoke primetime special starring Katy Perry. Fresh off the release of her song “Swish, Swish,” Perry has been at the center of renewed fascination regarding her relationship—or, more specifically, her long-running beef—with Taylor Swift. (Perry claims the song is a message against bullying in general, but it sure sounds a response to Swift, who famously is rumored to have written Bad Blood about Perry.) 
  
 During the Late Late Show special, Corden dutifully asked about the feud—and Perry happily delivered a narrative from which we’re guessing Swift would very much like to be excluded. 
  
 “I want to talk to you about some famous beef,” a chipper Corden offered. “Because there’s Taylor beef . . . When are we going to clear that beef up?” 
  
 Perry could have demurred, as she has in the past. Instead, she responded straightforwardly to Corden: “Honestly, it’s really like, she started it, and it’s time for her to finish it.” 
  
 Carpool Karaoke might be fun and games for viewers, but for several celebrity guests, it’s also served as a pit stop on an obviously well-planned P.R. tour. Consider, for instance, Justin Bieber’s first Carpool Karaoke, which helped redeem him ahead of Purpose, an album designed to rehabilitate his public image. (It was not, in fact, too late to say “Sorry.”) Even when Michelle Obama got her freak on with Corden and Missy Elliott, she took a few beats in between grooves to talk about her “Let Girls Learn” initiative. It’s unclear whether Corden asked Perry about the Swift beef because of her new song, or if he was externally nudged to do so. But either way, Perry got her message across. 
  
 As Perry confirmed—with a “Can you believe this?” air—on Monday, the feud was spurred by rumors that Swift was angry at Perry for poaching some of her back-up dancers. Since then, it’s been an ongoing parade of shady tweets and thinly veiled dis tracks. But according to Perry, the whole thing was a misunderstanding—one she tried to clear up. Swift, she told Corden, was the one who refused to communicate. 
  
 “I tried to talk to her about it, and she wouldn’t speak to me,” Perry said on Carpool Karaoke. When Corden tried to confirm that Perry had reached out via phone call, Perry continued: “I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me, and I’m like, O.K., cool, cool, cool, that’s how you want to deal with it? Karma! But what I want to say is that I’m ready for that B.S. to be done. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, there’s going to be a reaction, and trust me, Daddy, there’s going to be a reaction.” 
  
 “I find it weird when you call me ‘Daddy,’“ Corden replied. Then, Perry adopted a familiar line of argument: “It’s all about karma, right? I think personally that women together, not divided, and none of this petty bullshit, women together will heal the world.” 
  
 Swift, too, has adopted the language of feminism to deflect perceived slights in the past. But platitudes aside, until Swift shoots Perry a text to end this fight, we’re guessing there are probably a few more musical subtweets on the horizon.

 Taylor Swift Puts Entire Catalog On Spotify As Katy Perry Releases New Album 
  
 Breaking News 
  
 Taylor Swift's not dropping the bad blood with Katy Perry because she decided to drop huge Spotify news at the exact moment Katy released her new album. Boom goes the dynamite. 
  
 It might be the pettiest move -- or just brilliant -- but Swift put her entire catalog of songs on Spotify and other streaming services Thursday night. It can't be coincidence Katy's "Witness" album also came out Thursday night. Right? 
  
 Seriously ... Taylor pulled her music from streaming sites in 2014, accusing them of not valuing her art. So, what changed and why now? Swift's camp says it's a thank-you to fans after her "1989" album sold over 10 million albums. 
  
 Her music will also appear on Amazon and Tidal now. Previously, it had only been available on Apple Music. 
  
 Katy Perry released "Swish Swish" a couple weeks ago ... which everyone took as her diss track response to "Bad Blood."

 You should retire 
  
 You’re ‘bout as cute as 
  
 An old coupon expired 
  
 And karma’s not a liar 
  
 She keeps receipts 
  
  
  
 Swish, swish, bish 
  
 Another one in the basket 
  
 Can’t touch this 
  
 Another one in the casket 
  
 Swish, swish, bish

 http://vevo.ly/i4nwdc ||||| Coincidence or competition? Twitter is going wild after Taylor Swift released her entire back catalog of music on all streaming services on the exact same day that Katy Perry dropped her new album, Witness. 
  
  
  
 The “Taylor Nation” Instagram account posted a statement on Thursday, June 8, saying, “In celebration of 1989 selling over 10 Million Albums Worldwide and the RIAA’s 100 Million Song Certification, Taylor wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services tonight at midnight.” The pop star, 27, previously pulled her songs from Spotify in November 2014 when she took a stand against the streaming service’s compensation plan for artists.

 Fans of the pop stars started going crazy when they realized that Perry’s album was also going live at exactly the same moment. The timing was even more interesting since the “Dark Horse” songstress, 32, has publicly discussed her feud with Swift multiple times in the last few weeks while promoting her fifth record. 
  
 Some tweeters were upset that Swift’s re-released music was stealing Perry’s thunder. “Katy Perry spent 4 years on her new album but got overshadowed by all of Taylor Swift’s old music being re-released,” one person tweeted. 
  
 Others were Team Taylor and loved her move. “Taylor Swift just ended Katy without having to drop an album,” one fan tweeted. Another user chimed in, “This is what Katy gets for name dropping Taylor in every interview."
