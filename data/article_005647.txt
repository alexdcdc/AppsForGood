Newsweek's new cover calls President Trump a 'Lazy Boy' 
  
 Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Newsweek’s latest cover has a lot of people talking. And maybe not surprisingly, it’s about Donald Trump. Buzz60 
  
 Newsweek doesn't shy away from criticizing President Trump in its latest issue. 
  
 Emblazoned on the issue's cover: "LAZY BOY: Donald Trump is bored and tired. Imagine how bad he'd feel if he did any work." 
  
 The cover features an illustration of the president sitting in a recliner with junk food, his phone and a remote. 
  
 Does Trump still want to be president? America’s boy king doesn’t like to work hard. Read our latest cover story: https://t.co/SPddThkJinpic.twitter.com/gyAhCqV4Up — Newsweek (@Newsweek) August 4, 2017 
  
 It also notes that in the six months Trump has been in office, he has spent 40 days at golf clubs and seen the passage of zero pieces of major legislation. 
  
 The cover, released late Thursday, is tied to Newsweek's story "Trump, America's Boy King: Golf and Television Won't Make America Great Again." The piece tackles the president's golf, Twitter and TV habits, wonders about his work ethic, and says the White House is in "disarray." 
  
 "Trump plainly wants his legacy to reflect that slogan on the baseball hat donned by his supporters," the piece concludes. "He wants to be the man who pulled America out of its postindustrial malaise, silenced talk of national decline and China’s ascent. But he can’t do that if he keeps sinking into his own debilitating malaise, weighed down by his shortcomings and an unwillingness to address them."

 Newsweek’s cover this week is a stunning portrait of President Trump — and not in a good way. 
  
 It depicts Trump as a couch potato commander-in-chief, slumped in a leather reclining chair, with the blaring headline, “Lazy Boy.” 
  
 Under that, it says, “Donald Trump is bored and tired. Imagine how bad he’d feel if he did any work.”

 Trump is shown wearing his usual navy suit, white shirt, and oversized red tie. 
  
 He has a bag of open Cheetos spilling onto his lap and leaving a trace on his shirt. 
  
 He has one arm wrapped around a bag of what looks like McDonald’s, and a diet Coke can in his hand. Next to the can, on his knee, is a cellphone. 
  
 At his feet, the edge of the presidential seal can be seen on the carpet. 
  
 On Friday, scores of people began using #lazyboy in their tweets.

 “Claiming the president is lazy is just outrageous. He’s the hardest working president in our time,” said Black. 
  
 He agrees with Trump’s remarks made in West Virginia Thursday night that if journalists are going to look into his alleged collusion with Russia, they need to look into what he believes could be far more serious crimes committed by the Clinton Foundation. 
  
 “I’m not saying anyone’s guilty, everyone deserves the presumption of innocence,” Black said. 
  
 The former newspaper publisher and author believes that in the current political climate it’s hard to come by a civil debate, and that opposing parties are rushing to extremes. 
  
 “They’re all addicted to the criminalization of policy differences…by all means let’s have vigorous fierce democratic contestation over elections and public policy, but every time you have a disagreement, sending your opponent to prison is not the answer of how to run the country,” he said.

 Black is hopeful that with the new White House Chief of staff hire, General John Kelly, the White House will have clearer messaging and that media attention will be refocused on policy. 
  
 “I think he’s a strong Marine Corps general and after one week, which is not long, there’s been no embarrassing tweets, everyone seems to be on message, and I think the president is absolutely right to call this whole collusion thing what it is. It’s just a smear job commissioned by [former FBI Director] Comey after he was fired,” said Black. ||||| It may be that Trump is overwhelmed. When I was training to become a teacher, veteran educators said students would use boredom to mask their inability to do the work. Is that what’s happening here? Well, to use a Trumpian construction, some people are saying so. One of those people is Donald Trump. In late April, the president confessed that he was both overwhelmed and frustrated. “I loved my previous life,” he said. “I had so many things going. This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.” That may be the most remarkable admission ever made by a sitting American president. Clinton’s infidelities, Nixon’s paranoia: Those were the usual failings of the powerful. But a disdain for power because wielding power is harder than pretending to wield power in a reality television series? That is Al Bundy coming home from another miserable day of work at the New Market Mall, cracking open a beer and wondering when his nightmare of shoe-selling drudgery will end. 
  
 The Royal Ennui 
  
 Now come the excuses. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” Trump said in February. Oh, but everybody knew. That’s why Obama spent months explaining his Affordable Care Act to Americans. Trump never held a town hall to sell his own “terrific” health plan, which mysteriously turned into the less-than-terrific slop cooked up by congressional Republicans. He didn’t campaign for that either, doing nothing to remake the lackluster legislation in his own splendid vision. 
  
 There were tweets from the president. There are always tweets. But little else. He maligned the House proposal as “mean” and casually introduced his own suggestions on Twitter to compete with McConnell’s in the Senate. Eventually, those Republicans concluded it would be infinitely more effective to craft the bill and marshal support without him. “White House officials privately concede that it is actually better for Republicans when the president disengages more from being a policy negotiator,” reported The Daily Beast as the Republican health care scheme headed for predictable disaster. It’s hard to imagine them seeking his engagement on other complex legislative matters. “His idea of work is a Hollywood idea of work,” says D’Antonio, author of the biography The Truth About Trump. “He ‘works’ in the way a king would work.” 
  
 The most impressive quality of Trump’s myth is not just that it strays from reality but how thoroughly, even aggressively, it contravenes easily confirmable fact. When he was king, he was the King of Debt, and he may still owe as much as $1.8 billion to creditors. His casinos closed. His airline went bust. But even as he accrued failures, lawsuits and debts, Trump managed to turn “Trump” into a synonym for success. The letters were made of plastic, but they were dipped in gold. 
  
 In a May interview with Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, Trump biographer Timothy O’Brien explained that after the erection of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan in 1983, “he never cared again,” so impressed was he with that monolithic monument to his ego. “He’s fundamentally lazy,” O’Brien told Dowd. “He free-rides so many processes he doesn’t know anything about. He used to do it in the business world, and now he does it in the political world.”

 Trump’s foray into politics would have been impossible without The Apprentice, which introduced him to Middle America, the onetime King of Debt reborn as a capable chief executive both ruthless and uncannily perceptive. But that was also an illusion, as we were recently reminded by Clay Aiken, the singer and onetime Celebrity Apprentice contestant. On a podcast last month, Aiken revealed that Trump wielded the show’s famous slogan—“You’re fired!”—at the instruction of others. The great leader of men was, at least in Aiken’s telling, a puppet. “The show’s producers from NBC made those calls,” explained a report in The Washington Post, “giving Trump instructions through a teleprompter on his desk that looked like a phone.” 
  
 Something must be said here in Trump’s defense. Laziness is frequently a trait we ascribe to politicians we dislike. Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chairman and Trump mentor, mused to a biographer of Obama: “How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time.… He’s lazy, but the media won’t report that.” Liberals weren’t especially nice to George W. Bush, either, lambasting Dubya for exercising too much, for going to bed at 9 p.m., for clearing brush on his Texas ranch when he should have been, well, not clearing brush on his Texas ranch. His forays from the White House were covered just as assiduously as Obama’s and, now, Trump’s. 
  
 I asked Tommy Vietor, a longtime Obama campaign and White House staffer, to compare Trump’s schedule to Obama’s. “It doesn’t seem like he works very hard,” Vietor tells me. “More importantly, it doesn’t seem like there’s any structure to his day. That’s a huge problem. It takes discipline to keep yourself from getting buffeted around by events of the day.” 
  
 Trump’s activities are hard to pin down because his daily schedule includes “downtime,” for which the White House does not provide detailed descriptions. Figuring out the president’s doings is “the holy grail of reporting” on Trump, Maggie Haberman of The New York Times told New Yorker editor David Remnick. Haberman, who probably knows Trump better than any other journalist, is still on the hunt. 
  
 There have been clues. Mark Leibovich, a politics reporter for the The New York Times Magazine, recently paid a visit to the White House and was, to his great surprise, led into “a small dining room just off the Oval Office” to meet the president. It was a weekday afternoon. Trump was alone, watching a recorded episode of Fox & Friends. 
  
 Donald, Not Ronald 
  
 When Trump hit the six-month mark of his presidency, Mike Pence, his unfailingly loyal vice president, marked the occasion with an op-ed for Fox News. Doing his best Soviet apparatchik imitation, Pence wrote that “President Trump’s accomplishments are nothing short of historic.” 
  
 Even by the dismayingly loose standards of political discourse, that is untrue. Although Trump has signed 42 bills since taking office, they are mostly minnows, whereas his supporters thought he’d be harpooning whales. An analysis by CNN found that 15 of those bills “have rolled back rules and regulations issued under Obama's administration, eight had to do with designating something or working to create a new initiative, five changed or expanded existing legislation, and 11 were related to government funding or operations.” One act renamed a courthouse for Fred Thompson, the actor and Republican senator. Aside from the ban on travelers from some Muslim-majority nations, his 42 executive orders have also been minor, undoing Obama’s legacy as opposed to creating his own. The grand gestures he promised remain the stuff of fantasy. The dealmaking he claims to have mastered remains holstered.

 It’s not just Trump. The entire White House is in disarray. White House political adviser Steve Bannon once grandly boasted that the Trump administration would undertake a “deconstruction of the administrative state,” but controlled shrinkage of the federal government would have required far more focus than the exhausting disarray now at work. The Washington Post, for example, has found that Trump has done little to fill “key positions” in his administration, with only 50 confirmed so far. Another 165 have been nominated, and while the White House will blame Democratic “obstructionism,” that hardly explains the 357 positions for which no one has been nominated. 
  
 Trump has held several campaign-style rallies since becoming president. He is good at these, and he enjoys them, as do his most ardent supporters. Even non-campaign events, like his appearance at the Boy Scouts of America National Scout Jamboree in late July, tend to remind us less of Ronald Reagan battling communism than of Donald Trump battling Hillary Clinton. That isn’t an accident. During the campaign, Trump did work hard, because it was on his own behalf, the glory of rapturous crowds redounding directly to him, not to some abstract institution of government. He branded himself as the can-do outsider who’d build that wall and lock her up. He branded his opponents as crooked, lying, low energy, emasculated, corrupt, crazy. It was a marketing campaign, and to Trump’s apparent dismay, it worked just a little too well. 
  
 Trump does have defenders more principled than Hannity and the Fox News commentariat. One of them is Greg Ip, a business-friendly economics commentator for The Wall Street Journal. In late July, Ip disputed the claim that Trump is a “do-nothing president.” Acknowledging that Trump hasn’t scored any legislative touchdowns, Ip claimed that Trump’s appointees “have begun nudging the economy and the country in a more conservative, pro-business direction.” Then again, Trump was never about incrementalism. “Make America great again” was policy shock and awe, not small-bore executive memoranda celebrated as if each were the Louisiana Purchase.

 Unable to take credit for his own achievements, Trump has laid claim to those of his predecessor. Obama took office during the Great Recession, when the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent and rising. Eight years later, as he prepared to leave the White House, it was 4.7 percent, a nine-year low. And yet Trump cites “absolutely tremendous economic progress,” as if he were the one who pulled the nation out of the foreclosure crisis. He brags about having quelled the flow of immigrants entering the United States illegally, but it was under Obama that illegal immigration fell to a 44-year nadir. Trump has, however, managed to keep out tourists. America has become so great, international travelers aren’t coming like they used to. 
  
 If you are one of the millions of Americans counting the days until Trump is no longer president, his failures may seem like victories. Except he is your president, and nobody wants to live in a nation in decline, a superpower devolving into a laughingstock. And while several of Trump’s proposals are either unworkable, unhinged or potentially disastrous, that’s not true for all of his ideas. There is infrastructure, above all, blessed infrastructure. The firing of 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air base in Syria was a sign that Trump knows Bashar al-Assad is a butcher of innocents who must be deposed. So why not marshal international support to remove him? And why expend so much energy keeping out the refugees who are Assad’s victims? 
  
 “His work ethic is just fine,” says Joe Walsh, the former Tea Party congressman from Illinois who now hosts a radio show. “His problem is he's focusing on the wrong things.”

 Some have likened Trump’s governing style to Reagan’s. Lou Cannon, who covered Reagan’s presidency for The Washington Post and later authored five books on his two terms in office, disagrees with any attempt to burnish Trump’s reputation by comparisons to the hero of modern American conservatism. “I can’t think of a single characteristic they share,” Cannon says. 
  
 Reagan was “much more diligent than President Trump is, in every respect,” Cannon tells me confidently. That diligence extended to the way he treated others, including White House staffers and political opponents. “He might not have known the details of the missile thing,” Cannon concedes in reference to 1983’s Strategic Defense Initiative, often derided in the press as “Star Wars” for its futuristic vision of national security. “But he’d know if an aide had a sick mother.” For example, after his mother died, Cannon got a call of heartfelt consolation from the president. 
  
 “Reagan had a conscious management style,” the historian reminds. “He wasn’t lazy.” 
  
 A Modern Harding 
  
 “Chicago Wine Party” was the seventh episode of the seventh season of Married...With Children. It premiered on November 1, 1992, a Sunday. The following Tuesday, the nation elected William Clinton as its next president. 
  
 Only five days later, a kind of despair had already set in, at least according to an unflattering report in The New York Times. Clinton’s supporters, wrote David Rosenbaum, “clearly recognized that the policy changes Mr. Clinton promised daily during the campaign can only take effect slowly, incrementally and painfully.” 
  
 Bundy was waging a political fight of his own. The premise of “Chicago Wine Party” involves a proposed 2-cent beer tax. About halfway through the episode, Bundy, bedecked in anti-beer-tax buttons, gives a rousing address: 
  
 The USA has been run too long by people who know the issues. People that watch the news on TV, read books, generally pay attention... well, no more. 'Cause now it's time that WE had a say in the future of America. Family...the Bundys are gonna elect a President. 
  
 It took 25 years, but the Bundys now have their man in the Oval Office. And while the election of Trump may have been a middle finger thrust at the coastal establishment by the white working class, it was also an expression of grievances legitimate and pervasive. Trump channeled those grievances masterfully for his campaign, but the urgency of those days is gone.

 Trump is a fighter, but before November 8, 2016, he only fought for himself. He never served in the military. He rarely gave to charity. “He’s a terribly self-indulgent individual,” says Robert Dallek, the noted presidential historian, who doesn’t think the weight of the presidency has “fully taken hold yet.” It may never. In his firing of FBI Director James Comey, his humiliation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his casual disregard of ethics rules, Trump has made it clear that he sees the White House as little more than a branch office of his marketing business, the Trump Organization. 
  
 As his crude dismissal of Comey demonstrated, Trump has little interest in understanding the scope of the executive branch, of limits set by tradition and the U.S. Constitution. And he will always defend his gilded image, even when he should be defending loftier goals. There have been countless reports in recent months that Trump supporters “don’t care” about the investigations of his campaign’s potential collusion with Russian hackers and the Kremlin. What that statement—often treated like a revelation—misses is the obvious fact that Trump deeply cares about the Russia probes. Judging by his Twitter account, there are many days when he cares about nothing else. 
  
 Dallek compares Trump unfavorably to presidents like Lyndon B. Johnson, who endlessly “cajoled” legislators to pass landmark civil rights and anti-poverty bills. For all his dealmaking skills, Trump hasn’t shown much ability to negotiate with Congress, probably because it would require a knowledge of what members of Congress want, need and, above all, fear. And that would require doing homework. It’s much easier to just threaten Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski on Twitter. It’s also a lot less effective. 
  
 Trump reminds Dallek of Warren G. Harding, whom he calls “the least effective president” before the current one. “He didn’t have the big picture or the small picture,” Dallek says of the man known as Wobbly Warren. “He was not very bright.” 
  
 Trump plainly wants his legacy to reflect that slogan on the baseball hat donned by his supporters. He wants to be the man who pulled America out of its postindustrial malaise, silenced talk of national decline and China’s ascent. But he can’t do that if he keeps sinking into his own debilitating malaise, weighed down by his shortcomings and an unwillingness to address them. He is entitled to rage at insults and defeats. Achilles raged, too. But then Achilles fought, leaving aside personal slights to charge the ramparts of Troy. Trump’s approach is the approach of Al Bundy. It begins in rage. It ends there, too. Both the president and the shoe salesman are driven by their unreasonable demands and unsoothable grievances to the couch, where they sit in front of the television, stewing. ||||| President Donald Trump won’t want to hang this uncomplimentary magazine cover at any of his golf clubs. 
  
 Newsweek depicted the president as a junk food-eating television addict on the front of its next issue, dated Aug. 11. 
  
 Under the headline “LAZY BOY,” the edited photo shows Trump slumped in a recliner with a remote control in one hand and a Diet Coke in the other. An open bag of Cheetos is perched on his lap while an empty McDonald’s hamburger carton is discarded on the floor. 
  
 “Donald Trump is bored and tired,” the sub-headline reads. “Imagine how bad he’d feel if he did any work.” 
  
 Newsweek shared the cover on its home page late Thursday, two days after it published the cover story itself, which examined “America’s boy king” and his apparent lack of enthusiasm for the job.
