Fellowes, a "lifetime devotee of Trollope", said he "could not be more delighted" to be writing the three-part drama, which will be on ITV.
The drama will tell the story of Dr Thomas Thorne, who lives in an English village with his niece, Mary.
In March it was announced that Downton Abbey is to end after six series.
Fellowes added that Trollope was his "favourite among the great 19th-Century English novelists and certainly the strongest influence over my work that I am conscious of".
Doctor Thorne, set in in the village of Greshamsbury in Barsetshire, explores the troubled love life of Mary, who has many assets but is not financially secure.
She has grown up alongside the Gresham sisters - Augusta, Beatrice and Alexandrina and their handsome brother Frank - whose home is the great house and estate at Greshamsbury Park.
ITV's director of drama, Steve November, said: "We're delighted to be working with Julian once again.
"It's a rich and multi-layered story of class and social standing and a timeless love story which Julian has brought to life brilliantly with his inimitable wit and warmth."
Filming for the drama, produced by Hat Trick Productions, will begin later this year.
