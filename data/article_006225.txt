The broadcaster aired 30 episodes of the hour-long show, titled Mel and Sue, in January and February.
But it has not been recommissioned. An ITV spokesperson said: "Mel and Sue are great talents and we hope to work with them on other projects in the future."
The pair have returned as hosts of BBC One's The Great British Bake Off, which attracted 10 million viewers last week.
Their success on Bake Off was one reason why ITV gave the hosts their own show, which featured celebrity guests and cookery demonstrations.
The show, in a format similar to the Channel 4 Light Lunch series which launched their TV careers in the 90s, attracted an average 790,000 viewers.
But it was regularly beaten by other shows in the same 16:00 time slot including Escape to the Country and Antiques Road Trip, which attracted around two million viewers.
