The coroner has begun summing up nearly two years' evidence into the disaster.
Sir John Goldring also told the jury it would be asked if "error or omission" by emergency services, match planners, football supporters and stadium design contributed to the 1989 disaster.
He said the question of how the 96 died was "the most controversial".
There are certain words such as "crime" the jury should not use, he added. However, he said words such as "failure", "inappropriate" and "inadequate" could be used.
Over the next three weeks, the coroner will review evidence on how 96 Liverpool fans died at the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield.
The jury is due to retire to consider its verdicts on 22 February.
The issue of unlawful killing is one of 14 questions the jury will have to answer which will also include whether opportunities were lost to save lives.
Sir John has called more than 500 witnesses including survivors, police and medical experts during the inquests, which began on 31 March 2014.
They are already the longest in English legal history.
