Cheshire Police released the statistic as they launched a campaign to urge male victims to report abuse.
Officers said they were raising the issue in the run-up to Valentine's Day, "when relationships are at the forefront of everyone's mind".
Information about help will be in GP surgeries, community centres, shops and sports centres.
Assistant Chief Constable Phil Thompson said: "Domestic abuse knows no boundaries and it can happen to anyone at any time regardless of gender, age and sexuality.
"Men in particular find it hard to speak out if they are being abused, but we want to reassure anyone who may be suffering at the hands of another, that domestic abuse is an issue that we take extremely seriously - whatever time of the year.
"Traditionally the emphasis has been on female victims of abuse but it is important to highlight the fact that many victims of domestic abuse are also men.
"By bringing this important issue to the front of people's minds we hope that it will encourage any men to have the confidence in contacting us if they want to end the cycle of abuse."
