Mario Balotelli gave manager Brendan Rodgers a timely reminder of what he is capable of as the misfiring Liverpool striker hit the target during an indoor training session, although it was only a bottle and not the net. The 24-year-old has failed to impress for the Reds since his £16million move from AC Milan last summer, scoring just twice in all competitions - and still without a goal in the Premier League. Such was his lack of form and playing time, the maverick Italian was linked with a move away from Anfield in the recent transfer window, but a return to Italy failed to materialise.
