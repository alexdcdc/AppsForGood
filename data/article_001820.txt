(CNN) -- Each year, Dr. Paul Dell and his wife, Ruthie, host Hand Camp, a refuge for children and teens with upper-limb abnormalities. Campers get to try arts and crafts, archery, and rope climbing in an environment away from teasing. The Dells, along with their staff of therapists and volunteers, work with the kids and their parents, offering advice and answering medical questions. More than 300 participated in this year's Hand Camp in Starke, Florida.
