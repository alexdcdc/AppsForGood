At precisely 3:56 p.m. on Thursday, Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced a popular Internet symbol for a careless shrug of the shoulders — ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ — into the Congressional record, holding it up on a placard and describing it as “a pretty good summary of what the Republicans’ plan is,” if the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Act this summer. 
  
 Pointing to the symbol, known as a shruggie, Mr. Murphy suggested that “the Republicans’ plan if King v. Burwell goes in favor of the plaintiffs is essentially a shrug of the shoulders.” 
  
 As Kyle Chayka explained in a post for The Awl last year, “The shruggie or ‘smugshrug,’ as it is sometimes called, is what’s known as a ‘kaomoji,’ or ‘face mark’ in Japanese. It’s similar to an emoji or emoticon, but it incorporates characters from the katakana alphabet, instead of underscores and carets, for a wider range of expression.” 
  
 The symbol of a “lopsided, grinning face with upturned palms,” Mr. Chayka added, “is fundamentally connected to the experience of being online, in part because it cannot be spoken, only acted or typed.” And, like learning a new word, once you learn the meaning of the symbol, it does seem to be everywhere on the Internet.

 Similar to an emoticon, the symbol uses characters from the katakana, a part of the Japanese writing system. It first gained popularity online after Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift’s MTV awards show acceptance speech. 
  
 Murphy used the symbol to suggest his disgust with GOP arguments about a response to a Supreme Court case that could leave millions without subsidies used to buy healthcare via ObamaCare exchanges. 
  
 The Supreme Court is considering whether to not allow people to get subsidies on the federal ObamaCare exchange in the King v. Burwell case. 
  
 “The Republican response to King v. Burwell is simply to repeal the Affordable Care Act,” Murphy said from the Senate floor. His speech included a sign that said “the Republican King v Burwell plan summarized: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ .” 
  
 The senator added that he was “frankly totally confident” that the Supreme Court would side with the government in the healthcare battle. 
  
 “There's no other way to read the Affordable Care Act other than to believe that subsidies go to both state and federal exchanges,” he said.
