He fired in from the edge of the box on 11 minutes before doing the same from slightly further out with another low, right-foot shot soon after the break.
Clayton Donaldson pulled a goal back on 53 minutes.
But that was all they could manage against a side reduced to 10 men in injury time when Alex Mowatt saw red.
Birmingham, who remain nine points adrift of sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday, had failed to win in five games prior to Saturday's victory at Reading.
That weekend win had suddenly rekindled their play-off hopes and Blues began the night knowing that they had the chance to reduce the gap to six points.
Their task was made a whole lot harder when Dallas fired the first of his two goals into the bottom left corner.
But his second proved the killer blow, despite the home side pulling one back within three minutes,
Donaldson hooked home his ninth goal of the season after Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri did well to keep out David Cotterill's powerful shot.
That gave Blues over half an hour to level but substitute Diego Fabbrini's wild shot over the bar from six yards was the closest they came to an equaliser.
Mowatt's red card for a late tackle on Ryan Shotton came too late to matter, as Blues slumped to only a second home defeat in 12 games.
