Jon Bernthal says he was privy to aspects of Kevin Spacey‘s alleged inappropriate conduct before the slew of recent sexual assault or harassment accusations were leveled against the star. 
  
 The actor told SiriusXM, “I just remember losing a ton of respect for him,” when asked to discuss their time working together on the summer hit Baby Driver. 
  
 “I remember being on that set and I remember him really rubbing me the wrong way,” recalled Bernthal. “And it’s funny, anybody who I was working with at the time, and people in my life remember me saying it and a lot of people reached out to me when that happened.”

 The actor, 41, explained that he was a longtime fan of Spacey, revealing that as a young theater actor he saw the House of Cards star perform in a production of The Iceman Cometh in London. “[It was] unbelievable sort of transformative experience in my life watching what he did and he was one of my favorite actors,” said Bernthal. 
  
 “The kind of man he was when I saw him, working with, made me lose all respect for him and I was enormously disappointed,” said Bernthal of finally working alongside Spacey in the 2017 film. 
  
 He further elaborated, “Going onto that set and working with him, I wasn’t there much and I wasn’t really in a situation to judge, but when I was there he really rubbed me the wrong way. I thought he was a bit of a bully… I didn’t really care for the way he was behaving toward some of the other people on set.”

 “I think he was acting toward people in a way that where I remember, at the time, thinking, man if that was a woman that he was talking to I would have done something, I would have said something,” said the actor. “And I was really happy to sort of get out of there.”

 Bernthal noted, though, that he never witnessed behavior from Spacey like some of the sexual conduct allegations that he’s now facing. 
  
 In a BuzzFeed article posted Oct. 30, actor Anthony Rapp alleged that Spacey made inappropriate sexual advances toward him when he was only 14. Hours later Spacey, 58, apologized for his behavior – which allegedly occurred at a party in 1986 — and came out as gay. 
  
 Further allegations have since emerged, including a report from CNN in which eight people who currently work or previously worked on House of Cards claimed that star and executive producer created a “toxic�? work environment through sexual harassment and “predatory�? behavior. 
  
 Last week, Netflix officially parted ways with Spacey, announcing that House of Cards‘ final season will be without the actor.

 The first accusation of sexual misconduct against Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey landed on Oct. 29, and a little more than a week later more than a dozen men — including five who said they were teens at the time — have come forward to allege he sexually harassed, assaulted or attempted to rape them. 
  
 Here is a list of accusers, some of them named, some of them anonymous. 
  
 Spacey's lawyers, Todd Rubenstein and Bryan Freedman, have not returned calls and emails from USA TODAY seeking comment. 
  
 1. Anthony Rapp, an actor on Star Trek: Discovery, told BuzzFeed in an interview on Oct. 29 that Spacey made sexual advances in 1986, when he was 14, in Spacey's New York apartment. Spacey issued a statement saying he was "beyond horrified" to hear the accusation, insisting he didn't remember the encounter but apologizing to Rapp. In the same statement, he came out as gay for the first time in public, infuriating gay rights advocates who viewed his acknowledgment as a false conflation of homosexuality with pedophilia in an attempt to distract attention from the underlying accusation.

 2. Roberto Cavazos, a Mexican actor, said in Spanish in a Facebook post on Oct. 30 that Spacey fondled or tried to fondle him against his will while he was at the Old Vic theater in London and Spacey was artistic director there. "Those of us who were around him at the Old Vic know that a lot more people will come forward with their stories in the coming days and weeks," Cavazos said in the post. 
  
 3. Daniel Beal, told London tabloid The Sun on Oct. 31 and The Daily Mail on Nov. 7 that in 2010, when he was 19 and working as a bartender in a West Sussex hotel, Spacey exposed himself to him outside the hotel while he was on a cigarette break. He continued, saying Spacey gave him an expensive watch to buy his silence. 
  
 4. Justin Dawes told BuzzFeed on Nov. 3 he was 16 and a theater usher in New Haven, Conn., in 1988, when Spacey, then appearing in a play there, invited him and a male friend to his apartment to watch a movie. Instead, Dawes said, Spacey gave them cocktails and played pornography on the TV. Dawes said it was "awkward" but not intimidating, and they left without incident. Still, “He knew that I was in high school. It was pretty clear. It's not like I was pretending to be an older, cooler person.” 
  
 5. Mark Ebenhoch was a 35-year-old military advisor working in uniform on the set of 1995's Outbreak when, he said, Spacey (who had a role in the movie) instructed one of his "harem" of young male crewmembers to solicit him for sex with Spacey, BuzzFeed reported on Nov. 3. Ebenhoch turned him down feigning disgust because he was then in the closet himself and feared repercussions for his career. “As a military adviser the last thing you’d want anyone to know is that you were gay,” he told BuzzFeed. 
  
 6. Harry Dreyfuss: The son of Oscar-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss wrote a first-person column in BuzzFeed on Nov. 4 describing how Spacey groped his genitals when he was 18 and his father was in the room. Harry Dreyfuss said it happened in 2008 in London when Spacey was directing his father in a play at the Old Vic and the three were alone in Spacey's apartment rehearsing lines.

 His father didn't see it, and he didn't tell him until many years later. Instead, Harry Dreyfuss, now an actor and writer in Los Angeles, told jokes about it at parties, although now he realizes there was nothing funny about it. “Kevin Spacey is a sexual predator. But I still never thought talking about it seriously was ever an option.” Buzzfeed quoted Bryan Freedman, one of Spacey's lawyers, as rejecting Harry's allegation: “Let me be clear, Mr. Spacey absolutely denies the allegations.” 
  
 7. Tony Montana told USA TODAY on Nov. 1 that a drunken Spacey confronted him in 2003 at a Los Angeles pub, groped his genitals and chased him into a bathroom. "He grabbed my whole package, he grabbed me hard; no one had ever done that to me," said Montana, who was then in his 30s.

 8. Kris Nixon, a 20-year-old bartender from Belfast, was working at a bar Spacey frequented near the Old Vic in 2007. He told People and The Sun on Nov. 6 he was invited to a party at Spacey’s London apartment; he was sitting on a sofa when Spacey sat beside him and grabbed his crotch. "He was drunk but not paralytic. I walked over to (my girlfriend) and said, ‘We need to leave.’ ” He brushed it off as "just some drunk guy" and never reported the incident. "It was my word against his and who is going to believe me?" 
  
 Anonymous accusers: 
  
 9. Anonymous bartender: London police said on Nov. 1 it is investigating an allegation by a man, then 23, who said Spacey sexually assaulted him in 2008 after he passed out at Spacey's London home where he had gone seeking advice on his career. He left after Spacey warned him to keep quiet about it. 
  
 10. Anonymous New York artist: A former child actortold Vulture on Nov. 2 that he began a sexual relationship with Spacey in 1983 when he was 14 and Spacey was 24, and that it ended when he was 15 and after Spacey allegedly attempted to rape him. He said he believes Spacey is a "pedophile." 
  
 11. Anonymous production assistant: CNN reported on Nov. 2 that a former production assistant on House of Cards said Spacey sexually assaulted him, putting his hand down the assistant's pants while Spacey was driving them to the Baltimore-area set during one of the show's early seasons. The assistant said the touching was non-consensual. 
  
 12. Anonymous British journalist: BuzzFeed reported on Nov. 3 that a British journalist then in his 20s interviewed Spacey for a magazine in London in the early 2000s and afterward went to a club with Spacey and some of his friends. He said Spacey repeatedly grabbed his genitals and angrily tried to block him from fleeing. The journalist realized he could not write about the encounter because it meant outing then-closeted Spacey as gay. "If I were to publish a story about Kevin Spacey sexually harassing me on the job … there's no way without making it quite clear that he likes guys," he said. The interview ran without his byline. 
  
 13. "John" told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire on Oct. 31 that Spacey tried to seduce him at his New York apartment in 1984 when he was 17. He said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa and woke up with the actor's arms around him. He said he didn't believe anything sexual took place, but added, "I was uncomfortable at best, traumatized at worst." 
  
 14. Heather Unruh's son: The former Boston TV news anchor held a press conference Nov. 8 in Boston to accuse Spacey of groping the genitals of her then-18-year-old son in a bar on Nantucket, Mass., in July 2016. Unruh said her son filed a report on the allegation with police and "a criminal investigation has been opened," though police said they could not confirm or deny that due to state law. If confirmed, his case would be the first under police investigation in America. And as the most recent, it could potentially lead to criminal charges. 
  
 15. Andy Holtmzan: In 1981, the NYU grad was working at The Public Theater in New York when Spacey, then 22 and an up-and-coming actor with a minor role in their production of Henry IV, Part 1, committed what he termed a "wordless assault." Holtzman told USA TODAY he was on a phone call when Spacey began his attack. 
  
 "Within minutes, wordlessly, he was up and all over me," Holtzman, now a 64-year-old marketing consultant, recalled. "The aggression was certainly more than a grope. When I was finally able to push him off and scream (at him), he theatrically stepped back, incredibly angry, grabbed his coat and bag, stormed out and slammed the door." 
  
 Holtzman said the encounter, which happened when he was 27, left him more stunned than traumatized. He was gay and comfortable with his sexuality but said he wasn't interested in Spacey, who was then in the closet. He couldn't fathom why the actor would do such a thing to him and then react the way he did when he was rebuffed. 
  
 "It was the look on his face that was really shocking and then scary," Holtzman said. "The anger was undeserved. If you ask for something and get a no, then I can understand the anger, but you ask for nothing and then try to take everything? Where is that anger coming from?"

 Kevin Spacey has been accused by more than a dozen men who say he sexually harassed, groped, assaulted or attempted to rape them in allegations spanning decades since Oct. 29. 
  
 The latest developments: 
  
 Spacey to be cut entirely from 'All the Money in the World' 
  
 In an unprecedented move, beleaguered star Kevin Spacey will be completely cut from his upcoming film, All the Money in the World. 
  
 Instead, USA TODAY has confirmed, Christopher Plummer will be brought in to reshoot the role of J. Paul Getty in the story about the infamous 1973 kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III. 
  
 According to a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it, the decision was director Ridley Scott's and Sony is supporting his decision. 
  
 Scott and Sony are still committed to hitting the scheduled release date of Dec. 22. 
  
 Former news anchor says Spacey assaulted her son 
  
 Heather Unruh, a former TV news anchor in Boston, said in a press conference Wednesday that the Oscar-winning actor assaulted her son, who was 18 at the time. Holding back tears, Unruh said in July 2016 that Spacey stuck his hand in her son’s pants and on his genitals at a bar in Nantucket, Mass. 
  
 Unruh said her son told Spacey he was of legal age to drink, and "Spacey bought him drink after drink after drink and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him." 
  
 She continued, saying Spacey urged her intoxicated son to go to a private after-party to continue drinking, but a concerned bystander asked her son if he was OK. When he relayed that he was not, Unruh said the woman told her son to run and he did. 
  
 "Nothing could’ve prepared my son for how that sexual assault would make him feel as a man," she said. "It harmed him and it cannot be undone." 
  
 Unruh said her son filed a police report last week and provided evidence to Nantucket police. She says a criminal investigation was opened, though the Nantucket Police Department declined to confirm that to USA TODAY, citing Massachusetts law forbidding it. 
  
 Tara Miltimore , assistant district attorney and spokeswoman for the Cape & Islands District Attorney's Office, confirmed to USA TODAY that "an individual has provided information to the Nantucket Police regarding an allegation of an indecent assault and battery." She said the state statute of limitations for indecent assault and battery is six years. 
  
 Unruh said her son did not report the encounter to police because he was embarrassed and fearful. Now, she said, her son is "committed to doing what he can to stop Kevin Spacey from victimizing anyone else." 
  
 She also had a message for the actor. 
  
 "To Kevin Spacey I want to say this: Shame on you for what you did to my son and shame on you for using your apology to Anthony Rapp to come out as a gay man," she said. "That was an appalling attempt to distract attention away from what you really are: a sexual predator. Your actions are criminal." 
  
 Unruh appeared with attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who has represented victims of clergy sexual abuse, at a downtown Boston hotel. Garabedian, who also has represented an accuser of Bill Cosby, was portrayed in the Oscar-winning film, Spotlight, about The Boston Globe's investigation of clergy sexual abuse in the Boston Catholic archdiocese. 
  
 "The civil claim against Kevin Spacey happened in Massachusetts and is well within the civil statute of limitations," Garabedian said. "It is also within the criminal statute of limitations. I am informed that my client did speak to the Nantucket police department and they are conducting an investigation." 
  
 Spacey's reps did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment. Spacey issued a statement on Twitter following Rapp's allegations, saying he was "beyond horrified" and insisting he didn't remember the encounter. In the same statement, he came out as gay for the first time in public.
