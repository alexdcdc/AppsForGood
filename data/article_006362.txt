Illinois-born Joshua Ferris was announced as the winner of the title at the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea on Thursday night.
His novel, To Rise Again At A Decent Hour, was picked by a panel of judges from a shortlist of seven authors.
President of the prize, Peter Stead, said it is "a novel which encapsulates the frustration, energy and humour that goes into the making of New York."
Mr Ferris, who lives in New York, is the author of two previous novels; Then We Came to the End and The Unnamed.
In 2010 he was chosen for The New Yorker's '20 Under 40' list of fiction writers.
To Rise Again at a Decent Hour is a dark comic novel centred around a frustrated New York dentist.
The competition, which began in 2006, is open to authors aged 39 and under who have been published in the English language.
Mr Ferris receives Â£30,000 and a bronze cast of Swansea-born poet Dylan Thomas for winning the competition.
