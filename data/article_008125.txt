Ruairi Keating came off the bench with 10 minutes to go and later struck his first goal for the Gulls by converting a Daniel Sparkes pass.
The Devon side had taken a 36th-minute lead when Sparkes supplied a left-wing cross which Luke Young converted for his second goal in three games.
The National League's bottom club levelled just two minutes into the second half when Jim Stevenson's fierce strike went in off the left-hand post for his third goal of the campaign.
Torquay goalkeeper Brendan Moore made a couple of great saves in the second half and Louis Almond also went close with a header for Southport towards the end, but Keating struck at the death to push the visitors above Woking in the table on goal difference.
