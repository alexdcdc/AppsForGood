Plus Dane Housing said they had decided to sell 10 Admiral Grove in Toxteth, Liverpool, following the death of "well-respected" tenant Margaret Gorse.
A spokeswoman said restrictions on the sale would mean it could not be turned into a tourist attraction or museum.
Starr moved into the terrace from nearby Madryn Street as a small child and lived there until finding fame.

Plus Dane director Claire Griffiths said the company felt the decision to sell would be "most beneficial to the community as any profits made will be reinvested back into Plus Dane homes in the area".
The housing association's spokeswoman said the property "still attracts fans daily", adding that Ms Gorse, who lived there for 37 years, "was always happy to invite people in to have a look inside the house".
