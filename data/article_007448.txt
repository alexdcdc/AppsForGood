Fassbender, who stars in the lead role, described the island as "cold, wet and beautiful".
Considine said some of the other members of the cast succumbed to hypothermia during the filming early last year.
He told the BBC at the film's Edinburgh premiere: "It got pretty bad there."
"A few people got hypothermia. We got hit by horizontal rain. It came and hit you sideways," added the actor who plays Banquo.
Fassebender said the production encountered "rain, sleet and snow - all the wetness of the elements".
Marion Cotillard, who plays Lady Macbeth, fell down a hole in a bog during filming.
Fassbender said: "One minute she was there, the next she was gone."
But the actor also said Skye was one of the most beautiful places he had been lucky enough to visit.
Other actors have told of encounters with Scotland's weather.
Actress Scarlett Johansson described shooting scenes for Under the Skin in Scotland as "brutal, cold and wet".
Some of the filming for the science fiction movie was done in Glencoe in November 2011.
Based on a novel of the same name by Highlands-based author Michel Faber, scenes were also shot in Glasgow.
And Noel Clarke said he suffered frostbite while filming for Centurion, which also starred Fassbender, in the Cairngorms.
He said was checked by a member of the shoot's medical team and was found to have the early stages of the condition.
