Donald Nicholson, 93, initially thought he had lost them on the way to the unveiling of a Bomber Command memorial in Lincoln, in October.
The former flight engineer was reunited with them after they were taken to a local police station in Tyne and Wear.
The International Bomber Command Centre announced his death on its Facebook page and said he would be missed.
"It is with huge sadness we have to report the sad passing of Warrant Officer Donald Nicholson," a statement said.
"We had the great pleasure of getting to know Donald a little and will remember with great fondness his incredible sense of humour. Rest in peace."
Mr Nicholson, who flew 31 bombing missions, believed he lost the medals getting into a car as he left his home in Houghton-Le-Spring.
About 80 volunteers with metal detectors searched a field near the Bomber Command memorial to try and find them.
They were handed in to his local police station a week later.
