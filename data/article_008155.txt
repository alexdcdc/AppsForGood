Jehoshua Gross, 27, from London, travelled 60 miles to Llandudno, Conwy after his car had been severely damaged in a crash.
He did not stop because he observed the Sabbath from sunset on Fridays, Llandudno magistrates were told.
He pleaded guilty and was banned from driving for 15 months and fined Â£415.
The prosecution said that when travelling from London on July 29, Mr Gross had been in a "no fault" collision on the M56 motorway.
His Honda Civic had severe front-end damage after colliding with the back of a heavy goods lorry.
He then drove on the hard shoulder on the M56, A550 and A55 for "prolonged periods" to avoid heavy traffic.
At Colwyn Bay parts of the car flew off.
Another motorist alerted the police after following him to Llandudno.
Mr Gross told police that because of his religion he was not allowed to drive after sunset on a Friday.
The defence said his faith was an essential of his life and he observed the Sabbath for a 24-hour period until sunset on Saturday.
Magistrates ordered the damaged car to be confiscated by police.
Mr Gross will have to take a re-test before he can drive again.
After the case, PC Scott Martin of the North Wales Roads Policing Unit said his driving posed a "real risk of serious injury to other persons".
