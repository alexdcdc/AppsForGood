But the attention she got for the plunging green dress she wore was the inspiration behind Google Images.
The internet was clamouring for pictures and it quickly became the most popular search term ever and co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin created a way to satisfy that demand.
The revelation came in a blog by Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt this week.
That might not be what Geri Halliwell wants to hear.
The former Spice Girl wore the very same dress one month earlier, and while she looked good at the NJR Music Awards in France on the 22 January 2000, she didn't break the internet like J.Lo did.
Maybe it was just a case of right time. right place? After all, other iconic outfits also failed to launch a whole branch of the internet.
Here are our top five.
Starting at the beginning of iconic dresses.
Marilyn Monroe in the white dress she wore in 1955 film The Seven Year Itch.
It's from one of the most famous scenes in the movie and was by costume designer William Travilla.
Then there's all of Madonna's pine cone bras. Who could forget.
Here she is performing in her classic gold number.
Not sure what Cher was doing with this lingerie-headdress combo, but it certainly caused a stir at the Oscars in 1986.
Bob Mackie designed the outfit and used rooster feathers.
Often referred to as "that" dress - another Versace number caused a stir in 1994.
Liz Hurley wore the "safety pin dress" to the premiere of the film Four Weddings and a Funeral and there was a sharp intake of breath.
And here you go Geri, you may not have started Google Images, but you made our list.
Possibly the most memorable dress of the decade: Geri wore a flag at the Brit Awards in 1997 and Union Jack merchandise exploded in shops.
