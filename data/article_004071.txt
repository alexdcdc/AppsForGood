Sharon Edwards, 42, denies murdering solicitor David Edwards, 51, with a kitchen knife at their home in Chorley, Lancashire, in August 2015.
Mr Edwards was found dead two months after the pair married in Las Vegas, Manchester Crown Court heard.
A police officer heard the defendant make the threat, the jury was told.
Mrs Edwards was witnessed grabbing her husband's shirt and saying she was going kill him during the early hours of 23 August, shortly after they returned from a Spanish holiday.
The jury was shown police body-cam footage of the couple outside the Duke of York pub, before they were escorted home "worse for wear" in a police vehicle.
In the footage, Pc Michelle Davies was heard telling a colleague how Mrs Edwards was "screaming" at her husband, and "swinging off his shirt".
During the journey the defendant was heard telling him: "I swear David, when I wake up tomorrow I don't know what mood I'm going to be in."
Later that day Mr Edwards was pronounced dead, having suffered a stab wound to the chest, the court was told.
A black handled kitchen knife measuring 13in (34cm) in length and stained with blood was found at their home.
The court has previously heard how Mrs Edwards was said to have "quite liked the idea of being a solicitor's wife", but they began to argue after he was told he was losing his job.
During a police interview after her arrest on suspicion of murder, Mrs Edwards said her husband had walked into the knife, and refused to accept that he was dead.
She said he had been drinking a lot since he lost his job and had been "really depressed", adding that he had taken the knife and pointed it in her direction.
She said: "I took the knife from David and he walked into it. But he's not dead. I'm not being rude but he's not dead.
"I have not murdered my husband and my husband is certainly not dead."
