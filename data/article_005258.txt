They were rescued from the 11ft (3.4m) vessel after getting into difficulty a mile from Douglas at about 20:35 BST on Monday.
Without power, the yacht had drifted three miles away from the island.
The Douglas volunteer RNLI crew towed the yacht back to the Battery Pier where the coastguards were waiting to assist. No-one was injured.
