Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes sparking calls to speed up the implementation of a flood prevention scheme.
The Scottish government has announced the floods have triggered their Bellwin Scheme which helps councils with the cost of such natural emergencies.
Another rain warning is in place for parts of Scotland later this week.
The Scottish Borders was one of the worst affected areas by heavy rainfall and flooding over the weekend.
Homes were evacuated, many roads were closed and one school was forced to remain shut on Monday.
The situation is now improving but another yellow alert for rain covers parts of southern Scotland on Wednesday and Thursday.
Ms McLeod saw the full extent of the damage caused in Hawick during her visit to the area.
"I would like to thank our emergency responders who have been working round the clock to help those most in need," she said.
"I also want to pay tribute to the many volunteers who by offering food, transport and support to their neighbours showed a community spirit that all of Scotland can be proud of."
She said that with further rainfall forecast. it was expected that traffic and services would "remain disrupted".
"The Scottish government will continue to work closely with SEPA and Transport Scotland to monitor the latest updates so that we ensure our local authorities and the emergency services get the support that they need," she said.
"It is also important we recognise the impact of our significant investment in protecting people's homes and livelihoods from such extreme conditions.
"All of Scotland's existing flood defences worked over the weekend.
"This justifies the Scottish government's commitment to continue investing in flood defences."
