Adrian Zielinski, who had moved up to -94kg after winning gold in the -85kg in London, failed a drugs test at the Polish Championships in July.
The Polish Weightlifting Federation said the 27-year-old has a legal right to have his B sample tested.
His 25-year-old brother Tomasz was sent home from Brazil on Tuesday.
Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid which can help athletes to train harder and aids recovery time.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport's anti-doping panel in Rio has already heard Tomasz Zielinski's case and banned him from the Games. The International Weightlifting Federation will now decide on any sanction.
His is the third case to be heard by the specially-convened anti-doping panel since the Games started.
It banned Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova after she tested positive for blood booster EPO, and China's teenage swimmer Chen Xinyi has accepted a provisional suspension while a positive drug test is investigated.
