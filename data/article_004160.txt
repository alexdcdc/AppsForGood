Perth-based energy giant SSE has signed a deal for the supply of 2.5 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Norway's oil fields.
The five-year deal will start in October.
Statoil already supplies SSE with gas for domestic customers and its power stations.
It has an even larger supply contract with Centrica - which trades as Scottish Gas and British Gas - which will rise to 7.3 billion cubic metres per year by 2025.
Last year, SSE signed a deal with Statoil to supply 500 million standard cubic metres per year, in a six-year deal. That represented 6% of SSE's average needs.
This week's deal between the two companies supersedes that and increases the quantity five-fold.
In addition Statoil has a contract with SSE for the supply of 0.5 billion cubic metres of gas per year to the St Fergus terminal for the period October 2012 - October 2022.
Britain's total demand for gas is about 70 billion cubic metres per year.
Tor Martin Anfinnsen, senior vice president of marketing and trading at Statoil, said: "We are very happy to have made this agreement with SSE.
"Being the second largest supplier of gas and electricity in the UK, SSE is a significant player in a market that is very important to Statoil.
"The agreement takes our already established relations to the next level. The agreement with SSE is another confirmation of Statoil's position as a long term reliable supplier of gas to the UK."
