Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said he hoped to allocate the money ahead of the chancellor's Autumn Statement.
Philip Hammond has said that any EU projects signed off before then will be fully funded despite the UK's decision to leave the EU.
However, the funding may miss the 23 November deadline.
It is understood there are complications around the cross-border nature of the money.
The Irish government is believed to be concerned about its position and whether it will be reimbursed by the EU if it funds post-Brexit projects.
Mr Hammond has said that EU schemes signed off by November would be guaranteed funding even if they continue after the UK leaves the EU.
