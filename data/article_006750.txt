"The latest survey suggests that uncertainty related to the general election may have contributed to what appears to have been a disappointing level of transactions in the housing market over the spring," said Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist.
He said he was particularly worried about the pipeline of new properties being put up for sale.
