They found the 'intruder' wedged in the frame 8ft (2.4m) off the ground at Nottingham Trent University's Arkwright building.
Daniel De Niet and Tom Burdett had been returning home after a night out and said the man told them he had been there for five hours.
Carl Attar, 27,  was charged with burglary and remanded in custody.
Mr De Niet said the pair had been having a race on the way home when they took a short cut outside the Arkwright building at about 2:00 GMT on Friday.
"I got to the top of the stairs and I heard shouting and screaming for help," he said.
"I looked up and saw someone wedged in the window."
Mr Burdett said: "I turned the corner and saw a pair of legs sticking out of a window quite far up.
"I was in pure hysterics. I couldn't stop laughing for a good few minutes."
The pair initially thought he was a drunk student who got himself wedged in the middle of a prank.
But after the fire service freed Mr Attar, with a saw and a ladder, he was arrested on suspicion of burglary.
Mr Burdett said: "He was actually doing a handstand whilst his legs were jammed in place in the window frame.
"He was in a lot of pain, he was crying when we first got there. He was in a lot of distress, understandably so."
Mr Attar appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday and was remanded into custody until 2 February.
