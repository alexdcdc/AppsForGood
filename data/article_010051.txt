The 2011 Academy Award nominees were announced this morning, which can only mean one thing: Oscar nomination snubs!Who was left off this year's Oscar nomination short lists ? Surge Desk has a quick rundown of this year's snubs.The Boston-based crime film starring and directed by Ben Affleck was on several early prediction lists for best picture and scored a $23.8 million opening weekend , only to fall short of the 10-slot nominee list for the Oscars' top honor.The morning wasn't a total disappointment for Mark Wahlberg the producer -- considering that his film "The Fighter" scored seven nominations, including best picture -- but Mark Wahlberg the actor was probably hoping to score a best actor nomination for his performance as "The Fighter" himself, Micky Ward.Academy rules stipulate that nominees are placed in the category where they receive the most votes, so while some had high hopes for Steinfeld's performance as Mattie Ross in "True Grit" to land her in the best actress category, the young star will have to settle for a nomination as best supporting actress.Nolan's work on "Inception" generated eight Oscar nominations for the psychological thriller, and none of them include a nod to Nolan for best director.Nothing? Davis Guggenheim ("An Inconvenient Truth") and his critically acclaimed education documentary already won the Critics Choice Award for best documentary but couldn't find any love at all from the Oscars ||||| A few minutes ago in Los Angeles, Mo'Nique and AMPAS boss Tom Sherak announced the nominees for the 83rd Academy Awards. It was a good morning for front-runners like The Social Network and The King's Speech — the latter of which, with twelve nominations, had the most of any film — and a great one for Winter's Bone and Javier Bardem. Christopher Nolan, Mila Kunis, and Andrew Garfield were not so lucky. Your complete list, after the jump!
