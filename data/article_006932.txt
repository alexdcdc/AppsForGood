The 46-year-old was on his way to a church in Ashfield Street when he was attacked on Bardowie Street by two men.
He was hit with a glass bottle and punched before the men ran off with his rucksack at about 23:35 on Friday.
Police Scotland are treating the attack as a hate crime. The preacher sustained only minor injuries but was "very shaken", officers said.
The suspects were white and in their late teens. One is described as medium to heavy build, with a short dark crew cut hairstyle and wearing a grey hooded top, black tracksuit trousers and white trainers.
The second man has a slim build with short light brown hair, wearing a black hooded top and red tracksuit bottoms.
The preacher had just got off a bus on Saracen Street before the attack. The two men stole his rucksack which had a Bible and other possessions inside.
Det Con Alan Watt said: "On checking CCTV we can see the two suspects hanging about in Saracen Street a short time before the attack. I would appeal to anyone who recognises their description or who has information that will help officers with their enquiries to contact the Community Investigation Unit at Pollok via 101."
DC Watt said he was keen to hear from the driver of a grey Hackney taxi who was seen on CCTV just before the attack.
