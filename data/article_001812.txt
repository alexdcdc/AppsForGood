The 18-year-old was waiting at a bus stop on Beeston Road when she was dragged into a garden and sexually assaulted on the night of 6 March.
The CCTV footage shows the man following another woman off Wellington Street on the night of the attack.
West Yorkshire Police has appealed on BBC Crimewatch for her to come forward.
Detectives said the victim was left with serious head injuries and a fractured pelvis when she was struck over the head numerous times with a large stone before being raped at about 22:30 GMT.
In a reconstruction on the programme, the victim spoke of her ordeal, which was voiced by an actor.
She said: "I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened. I've stopped sleeping because I can see what happened when I am trying to sleep."
Det Sup Nick Wallen said: "This was an appalling attack on a young woman where a shocking level of violence was used which could so easily have had fatal consequences.
"It has understandably had a very significant traumatic effect on the victim.".
"We are hopeful that the woman shown being followed, who we have not yet identified, will come forward as a result of this new appeal."
Mr Wallen said the force was "continuing to conduct a very wide range of enquiries to identify" the attacker.
Detectives previously released CCTV footage, images and a description of the attacker, who is thought to be in his early 20s and of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin.
On the night of the attack, he was wearing a green Puma hooded top and white trainers.
An image of a footwear mark recovered from the victim's clothing was also released.
Last week it emerged three other women were stalked by the suspect prior to the attack on Beeston Road.
Police have warned women in the city to be on their guard.
