Matthew Baker, 28, was arrested at an address in Ilford, north-east London, on Wednesday night and is being held in police custody.
A 21-year-old woman and a man aged 33 were also arrested.
Baker was awaiting sentencing for attempted murder when he broke through cell bars at the north London prison with fellow inmate, James Whitlock, 31.
Police have renewed an appeal for information about Whitlock, who remains at large.
He had been on remand charged with conspiracy to steal from 19 cash machines across south-east England between last December and August.
He is described as of a slim build and has the name "Tracy" tattooed on his torso. Police advised the public not to approach him.
The man and woman arrested with Baker were taken to a police station in east London, where they remain in police custody, the Met said.
Baker was convicted on 4 October of the attempted murder of a man at a flat in Dagenham last year and was due to be sentenced on Friday.
He was found not guilty of making threats to kill against a woman who witnessed the attack.
It is understood he and Whitlock used diamond-edged cutting equipment to break cell bars before scaling the perimeter wall of Pentonville Prison.
In the days after his conviction, Baker warned his enemies they would "meet again one day", according to reports in the Sun newspaper.
The post on his Facebook profile read: "Let's get one thing straight to anyone who wants to say anythink behind my back.
"I know your names n where yous live n believe me we'll meet again one day n i dont forget nothinc just remember that yous know who yous are."
Baker and Whitlock's escape from G wing of the Victorian category B prison was discovered when officers carrying out checks found two pillows made to look like bodies in the prisoners' beds.
