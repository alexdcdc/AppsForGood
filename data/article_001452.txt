The arrests were made as part of an investigation by the Met's Counter Terrorism Command and MI5.
Scotland Yard said the arrests were "linked to activity in the UK".
The men, aged between 18 and 27, were arrested at their homes and are in custody. A further five residential addresses in east London will also be searched.
