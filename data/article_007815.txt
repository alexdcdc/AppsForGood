Every summer the prince and the Duchess of Cornwall spend a week at Llwynywermod, their farmhouse home in Carmarthenshire, and make a series of visits around Wales.
The theme this year is "celebrating Wales, past, present and future".
He began in south west Wales, touring a food firm using traditional techniques, a woollen mill and a cheese factory.
The prince was shown how staff at Cnwd Food Company at Cross Hands prepare and smoke sewin, which are caught locally from coracles using traditional methods.
The company makes products sourced from ingredients found in Carmarthenshire.
Next, the prince moved on to Melin Tregwynt woollen mill near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, in his role as patron of the Campaign for Wool, where he also met staff.
The heritage site has been adapted for modern use and employs 30 people in textile production.
He also attended an event celebrating the growth of the rural heritage and textiles industries in Wales, organised by Creative Skillset Cymru.
He rounded off day one with a tour of the Caws Cenarth cheese factory at Lancych, Carmarthenshire, which he last visited in 1998.
Highlights of the week include the royal couple commemorating Wales' coal mining heritage with a visit to the Welsh national mining memorial at the scene of Britain's worst pit disaster.
They will lay a wreath on Thursday at the memorial in Senghenydd near Caerphilly where an explosion killed 439 miners and a rescuer at Universal Colliery in 1913.
The memorial was unveiled last year on the site of the colliery, exactly 100 years on from the disaster.
