Philip Hollobone made the plea in the Commons in support of the wholegrain rectangles, which are produced in his Northamptonshire constituency.
He said the "great British breakfast cereal" should be served at all early meetings held by environment ministers.
Environment Secretary Liz Truss told him she kept a box of the cereal on her desk "for all visitors to see".
"It's a real example of linking farm through to fork," she said.
However, she did not go quite as far as agreeing to the request made by Mr Hollobone, the Conservative MP for Kettering.
In response to the exchange, Speaker of the House, John Bercow, quipped:  "We've learnt more about [the secretary of state's] domestic arrangements."
The House of Commons website said it "actively champions the producing, buying and eating of British food".
