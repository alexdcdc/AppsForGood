Douglas Slade, 74, who was living in Angeles City, was arrested by Filipino immigration authorities in June.
Deported to the UK, he was arrested on Wednesday and charged with eight child sex offences including gross indecency and incitement of gross indecency.
The offences were allegedly carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the Bristol area against three boys.
He is due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court later.
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said: "The charges relate to three male victims, who are now adults but were aged between 10 and 15 years old at the time.
"He [Douglas Slade] was expelled from the country following a decision reached by the Filipino authorities on the grounds of public safety.
"This was a deportation process unconnected with the UK investigation."
