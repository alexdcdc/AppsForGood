The 44-year-old Nottingham-born cueman has slipped outside of the top 64 and is in danger of losing his tour status.
Hamilton reached the third round of the Welsh Open this week and has shown glimpes of his best form after several years of struggle with a neck injury.
"Mathematically I'm against it now, but I am playing well," he told BBC Sport.
Hamilton is ranked number 68 in the world and his provisional ranking is in the 70s. He also seems unlikely to earn a place on tour through one of the eight places on offer through the Order of Merit on the European Tour events.
But if does miss out on a tour place, Hamilton, who has been as high as number 10 in the world, has no intention of giving up.
"I would try to get back on because I am playing well again and and I have been feeling fit body-wise since October," he said.
"Before October it was almost pointless, but now I can practise a bit. I am too good to be off the tour, in my opinion.
"It will be tough to get back on and I don't know what I would do next if it does happen."
