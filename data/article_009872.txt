The 51-year-old, president of Rogers Media in Canada for the last five years, will start his role this summer.
An "honoured" Pelley said he wanted to ensure golf remained at the "forefront of the game" across the world.
O'Grady, 65, had been chief executive of the Tour, which runs the three leading men's professional golf circuits in Europe, since 2005.
David Williams, chairman of the European Tour, said: "Throughout the interview process, it was clear Keith has an unwavering passion for golf, as well as a strong grasp of the challenges and opportunities facing not only the European Tour, but the wider game of golf as a whole."
O'Grady, who will now take up a presidential role to represent the Tour through the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, said he would ensure a smooth transition.
"I am certain Keith will bring a fresh and business-focused perspective to the Tour," he added.
