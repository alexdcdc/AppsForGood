No-one was injured in the crash, which happened at 13:55 BST on Friday at Judd's garage, near Woodstock.
Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue temporarily closed the site and isolated the fuel pumps and electrical power.
Fire crews also removed "dangerously hanging panels" from the canopy over the fuel pumps, so that the lorry could be driven away.
The station reopened after its structure was said to be safe by a building control officer from West Oxfordshire District Council.
Fire service group manager Julian Green said: "I'd like to stress how important it is for lorry drivers to know the height of the vehicle they are driving, and only to drive under low structures or bridges once they have double-checked the height of both the structure and their vehicle".
