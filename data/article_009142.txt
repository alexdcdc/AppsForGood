The garden designed by Stuart Charles Towner and Bethany Williams - who will both graduate from Hadlow College - is called Green Seam.
The designers say it tells the story of the regeneration of the former coal mine at Betteshanger.
After the flower show, the garden will be moved to the Betteshanger sustainable park scheme near Deal.
The Green Seam garden depicts the transformation of the site of the former colliery slagheap and includes steel structures and metal cables representing the shape of the colliery pithead.
Former Betteshanger miner, Gary Cox, said: "This is so important to us and we have got over 100 years of heritage and we have to remember what has gone on in our past in our communities."
Kent mining villages such as Betteshanger and Aylesham are still home to many ex-miners and their families.
Stuart Charles Towner said: "We wanted to represent the real people that are behind it - the miners - so the past is not forgotten."
Miners from Betteshanger colliery were heavily involved in the national coal miners strike which began in 1984 and lasted for almost a year.
Betteshanger was the last Kent colliery to close in 1989.
