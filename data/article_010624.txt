Morris was sin-binned after he took Thompstone out in the air during last Friday's 27-18 defeat by the Tigers.
After being cited, the 22-year-old pleaded not guilty at a Rugby Football Union hearing on Wednesday.
However, the governing body's three-man disciplinary panel found that the incident "warranted a red card".
"The Leicester player luckily sustained no serious injury and was able to play on. As such it was deemed a low end offence," a RFU statement added.
Morris will be free to play again on Tuesday, 21 March.
