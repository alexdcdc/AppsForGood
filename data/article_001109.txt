The singer and TV star died of a stroke after falling over at her Spanish home on Saturday last week.
The 72-year-old was sunbathing at her villa in Estepona when she stood up, lost her balance and fell, hitting her head, which knocked her unconscious.
In this week's singles chart, her 1964 number one hit Anyone Who Had A Heart narrowly missed out on a Top 40 return, re-entering the chart at number 41.
But her greatest hits album The Very Best of Cilla Black did register its highest-ever position on the album countdown, climbing to number 14 based on a surge of sales over the past week.
No details of Black's funeral have yet been made public.
Born Priscilla Maria Veronica White, the Liverpudlian first found fame as a singer in the 1960s, with a string of top 10 hits including chart-toppers Anyone Who Had a Heart and You're My World.
Her career focus shifted to television in 1968, when she was given her own BBC One primetime series, and she went on to host Blind Date and Surprise Surprise for ITV.
