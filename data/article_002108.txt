Scott Rennie, 34, from Newton Stewart, had been on the Ballantrae-registered King Challenger when the incident happened west of Scalloway on Thursday.
His crewmates managed to get him out of the water.
A Coastguard rescue helicopter then transferred him to Gilbert Bain Hospital, but he could not be saved. An investigation is being held.
