The 32-year-old Australia-born wicketkeeper/batsman has been at Edgbaston since arriving in 2006 from Sussex, where he was being kept out of the team by Matt Prior.
Ambrose has proved a big hit for the Bears, going on to win an England call himself in 2008.
"Tim thoroughly deserves this honour," said chief executive Colin Povey.
"He's been one of our senior players for some time. He's been almost ever-present for us in all formats of the game over recent seasons and has performed consistently well both behind the stumps and with the bat."
Ambrose, who signed a new two-year deal with the Bears at the end of the 2014 season, is currently in the process of agreeing a one-year extension to tie him to the county until 2017.
"I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at Edgbaston," he said. "Looking down the list of names of those who've had a benefit year in the past makes me realise just how much of a privilege it is to be afforded this honour."
The Bears' two most recent beneficiaries have been Jonathan Trott (2014) and former skipper Ian Westwood (2015).
