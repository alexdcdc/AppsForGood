Members of the NASUWT are staging a 24-hour stoppage after claiming their relationship with the trust running Whitehaven Academy has broken down.
Teachers who are members of the ATL and NUT are taking part in similar action on Friday.
The Bright Tribe Trust said it was working to tackle known issues.
The academy was hit by a strike by the NASUWT on 10 January.
The school, which caters for 620 pupils, was rated inadequate by Ofsted inspectors last October and placed in special measures after being told it must improve its leadership.
Unions said teachers had "serious concerns" about the way in which they were being managed and the working environment within the school.
Academy bosses said the industrial action was "disappointing" but added they were hopeful of further talks with unions.
The school said classes for Year 11 pupils would be held as normal over the two days of industrial action.
