The RNLI and coastguard have been searching the loch's Urquhart Bay while police have been looking in and around the nearby village of Drumnadrochit.

Police Scotland said that there was a sighting of Mr Gates in Aviemore in the Highlands on 12 March and believed that he later headed for Drumnadrochit.
Mr Gates is described as being about 6ft 3in tall, of a slim build, with short cropped greying hair and stubble.
It was not known what clothes he is wearing, but police said he was known to often wear black jeans, a t-shirt, a black padded jacket or a tweed jacket.
The RNLI's Loch Ness lifeboat has been searching the loch, while the coastguard helicopter has been involved in checks of forestry in the area.
