The 29-year-old former Marseille centre-back will join Ivory Coast's Gervinho at the Chinese club, after he signed from AS Roma on Wednesday.
"Looking forward to 'absolute beast defender' Mbia fully showing his  strength," the club said on twitter.
Mbia wrote on his Twitter page: "Proud to join Hebei China Fortune, ready for this adventure. Let's go."
