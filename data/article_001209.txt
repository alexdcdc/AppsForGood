The pudding was donated to the microbiology department to see if it was still fit to eat.
University of Nottingham's Christine Dodd was convinced it posed no threat to her students as it was steamed for five hours first.
The verdict: "It tastes amazing - honestly!"
The pudding, which contains fruit, bread crumbs and brandy among other ingredients, was located in the kitchen of a house.
Mrs Dodd said the results from laboratory tests will not be ready until after Christmas - but the tasters all agreed it was "a little bit dry but very good flavour".
She said any bacteria in the pudding would not have survived the five hours of steaming - and the potent combination of alcohol and fruit.

The researchers were told the pudding was made for the wedding of a relative in 1969 and has the date marked on it.
"We were interested to see just how well it had kept," Mrs Dodd said, adding they wanted to see "whether there was anything still 'live' in there and what condition it was in".
The laboratory results will take several weeks to complete and will be put on the university website.
