Dack took over as caretaker when former manager Justin Edinburgh left for Gillingham in February.
"The offer was there for me but I just felt that it was the right decision now for me to move," Dack said.
"I've had four fantastic years seasons at this football club and I've given my all in every season I've been here."
Former England captain Terry Butcher, ex-Mansfield boss Paul Cox, ex-Cheltenham manager Mark Yates and ex-England striker James Beattie are all understood to be in the running for the vacant post.
Dack would not be drawn on his reasons for stepping down but confirmed he does not have another job lined up to go to.
"That's personal between me and Howard [director Greenhaf] and the football club," Dack said.
"I decided that I've been here four years now, I've given everything for four years and... I just thought the time was right for me to pass the baton on and let someone else take the club on.
"I've come in and I've probably dealt with more in three months than most managers do in three seasons... it's made me a better person and a stronger person for it."
However when asked, the 42-year-old admitted he would like to be a manager elsewhere.
"Yes, that could be a possibility, but I would be a number two elsewhere as well," Dack added.
Dack will oversee Saturday's final League Two game at home to Oxford United on Saturday 2 May and is aiming to leave on a high, saying "I'm going to get three points".
County were promoted from the Conference Premier in 2013 under the guidance of Edinburgh and Dack, an achievement Dack says was one of his proudest moments at the club.
But the Exiles look set for a third season in the division despite last weekend's 2-0 away win over York.
Although Newport are just three points outside the play-off places with one game remaining, seventh-placed Plymouth have a goal difference of plus-18 over the Welsh side.
