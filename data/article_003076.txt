The section, which showed the story of Rosslyn Chapel, was taken from Kirkcaldy Galleries at about 10:00 on Thursday.
Fife Cultural Trust has appealed for help track down the missing panel and is helping police view CCTV footage.
The Great Tapestry features 160 individual panels which were stitched by more than 1,000 volunteers.
It took more than 50,000 hours to complete the work and at 143m long it is the world's longest embroidered tapestry.
The design tells the "story of Scotland" across  intricate panels.
Each covers a different period of Scottish history, from the Battle of Bannockburn to the reconvening of the Scottish parliament in 1999.
The tapestry has been on display at Kirkcaldy Galleries since 20 June.
The stolen panel was designed by artist Andrew Crummy.
Author Alexander McCall Smith, who came up with original idea for the tapestry, said: "This is a terrible blow for a project that has brought so much joy to so many people.
"I appeal to those who have taken this panel to return it. Words cannot express how shocked I am that somebody should damage in this way what is now widely seen as a great national treasure."
Laurie Piper, from Fife Cultural Trust, said: "The people of Fife have taken the tapestry to their hearts and we are now hoping that they will help us to bring it back where it belongs - alongside its 159 companions."
