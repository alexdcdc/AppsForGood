Officers were contacted with reports of a man seen in Colchester, thought to resemble one of the offenders involved in the attempted abduction in Norfolk.
A victim was threatened with a knife by two men who tried to force him into a car near the Norfolk base last week.
Police investigating the incident at RAF Marham confirmed the sighting was not one of the suspects.

The Norfolk force issued an e-fit earlier this week in an attempt to track down the two men, who fled the scene in a dark-coloured people carrier, which the police are still trying to trace.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said safety of personnel was "paramount".
