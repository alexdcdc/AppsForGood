Six classic cars were set alight at the premises on the Brustin Brae Road.
Owner John Murphy said he doesn't know why he was targeted.
"I have no enemies that I know of," he told the BBC.
The collection of cars represented 15 years of work for Mr Murphy. Amongst those destroyed were a Lotus Sunbeam and an MG.
When he discovered the damage, Mr Murphy said he was devastated: "It's bad enough having a break-in but they didn't have to burn the vehicles, it's just soul destroying. I intended to use the cars for my retirement.
"There have been quite a few robberies in this area recently, they come in the hours of darkness and leave a lot of mess behind them."
The vintage car fanatic said the fire has left the cars unusable.
"I'll try to save what bits I can, but the cars themselves are gone," he said. "Once the tin work is gone, there's no way you can really fix it. The cars are history."
