Richard Clay, 50, and business partner Kathryn Clark, 52, operated a firm called Arck LLP, convincing investors to part with, in some cases, their pension funds and life savings.
The pair previously admitted six counts of fraud and two of forgery.
The "elaborate scam" was uncovered in 2012, according to the Serious Fraud Office.
The Nottingham-based company received £47.5m from "several hundred" investors hoping to benefit from property development, including in Cape Verde, police said.
It was only after civil proceedings were initiated that the fraud was uncovered and the defendants were arrested in March 2012.
Clark, of Edwalton, Nottinghamshire, helped to forge bank statements to appease anxious investors, providing "a veneer of credibility" as she was authorised under the Financial Services Act.
One statement was falsified to suggest there was more than £12m in the firm's bank account, when there was just £25, an earlier Insolvency Service hearing was told.
Serious Fraud Office director David Green described the pair's crime as a "pernicious fraud".
Clay, of Belper, Derbyshire, was described as the "directing force" behind Arck's financial schemes, and sentenced to 10 years and 10 months in prison at Southwark Crown Court and given a serious crime prevention order to last for five years.
Clark was handed a two-year suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work.
At earlier hearings, Clay admitted three counts of fraud, while Clark pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud and two of forgery.
Both were disqualified from being a director of a company for 15 and 14 years respectively, by the Insolvency Service earlier this year.
A hearing to discuss confiscation proceedings is due to take place in March.
