The government has confirmed it intends to sell the 4.3 acre plot at Callaghan Square in Cardiff.
It was purchased for Grade A office development as part of the Central Cardiff Enterprise Zone.
A spokesman for the Welsh government said ministers are looking at ways in which the private sector "could purchase and positively develop" the site.
