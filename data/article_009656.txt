Fifty one firefighters are at the building on City Road, which is thought to be disused.
The road has been closed between its junction with Newport Road and The Parade and Talworth Street.
Smoke is billowing from the building and can be seen from as far away as Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan.
South Wales Police advised people living near the site to keep their windows closed.
Jennie Griffiths, head of South Wales fire service's joint fire control, tweeted to say the blaze involves the ground and first floor of the building.
She added: "1st floor well alight - building has suffered roof collapse."
She said firefighters were working to protect adjacent buildings.
Welsh Water has sent a text message to customers in the area, warning them their water may be discoloured due to the fire service fighting the blaze.
