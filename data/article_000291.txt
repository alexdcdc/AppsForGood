Members were balloted over job security at the university's medical school.
UCU Scotland said three-quarters of those who took part in a ballot voted for strike action. A petition will also be handed in on Tuesday.
The university expressed disappointment at the announcement.
UCU Scotland said all four members of staff now at the centre of the dispute were of Asian ethnic origin, which the union said raised the question of whether the process had been discriminatory.
A University of Aberdeen spokesman said: "We are disappointed that the UCU has decided to take strike action, and that they have chosen a date for the strikes which occurs during the student exam period.
"We will not allow our students' exams to be disrupted and have made arrangements to make sure this does not occur.
"Of the staff that were placed at risk of redundancy as a result of restructuring in the School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, the remaining four have been offered alternative employment on their current salary and grade. As a result, we no longer believe there will be a need for any compulsory redundancies.
"Regarding the concerns of UCU over the process that was followed, it is important to point out that the University of Aberdeen is an equal opportunities employer and takes this responsibility very seriously."
