U's striker Joe Pigott cancelled out Andre Dozzell's opener in the 89th minute after Town lost the ball.
"I'm not tolerating that, I've told them that's garbage," McCarthy said.
"To concede that goal is really poor. I'm fuming after that, I don't often lose the plot but I have [in the dressing room]."
McCarthy's side were on the wrong end of a number of late goals in the Championship last season, and McCarthy pointed to the examples at Brentford,Nottingham Forest and Bolton where they dropped points from winning positions late on in 2015-16.
Ipswich finished five points outside the Championship play-off places last season in seventh.
The former Republic of Ireland and Wolves boss continued to BBC Radio Suffolk: "That's a pre-season friendly and I say I'm not bothered about them and don't like them, but I don't like conceding goals at that time.
"It's unforgiveable for me. If he whacks one in from 30 yards, fine. But no, we had the ball and gave it away."
