Thain's bakers keeps the long hours at its George Street store to accommodate customers including shift workers and revellers.
It is being bought by Hatton-based family firm Murdoch Allan, which employs more than 100 people. Thain's has a staff of 50.
Murdoch Allan managing director Paul Allan said: "This new arrangement secures both businesses."
He explained: "I am particularly pleased that Graeme and Alan Thain will be remaining with the business which they have worked hard to build up over the years and which was founded by their late father, Jack Thain, in 1962."
Murdoch Allan bakery started in 1991.
