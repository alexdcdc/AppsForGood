New College Nottingham's Basford Hall campus, which dates back to the 1960s, was saved from closure six years ago.
At the time NCN had wanted to sell it because they said it would be too expensive to update.
Now the college has revealed it is consulting with residents and students on plans for a Â£27m expansion of the site.
College principal and chief executive, Amarjit Basi said: "There are still a number of stages for us to go through before we can make this development a reality, however we are genuinely excited about the potential for us to make a huge positive difference to the local economy.
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring redevelopment of this scale to Basford and its surrounding areas where the benefits will be felt for years to come.
"This proposal could boost job opportunities, significantly contribute to skills growth and invest in facilities the whole community can enjoy."
NCN said one of the options for the new college was to strike a deal with Nottingham City Council and build it on nearby park land.
MP Graham Allen, who campaigned to keep the Basford Hall campus open in 2006 says the investment is "long awaited" and "much needed".
"I whole heartedly support the extension and improvements and also have been assured there will be no loss of open space in the new design," he said.
"When it is finally delivered it will be a great day of opportunity for the young people of the high jobless areas of Bulwell, Basford, Aspley and surrounding neighbourhoods."
NCN says it is in the process of securing funding for the project from the Skills Funding Agency and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
The consultation with residents will centre on the location of the new college and identifying which community facilities are needed in the area or need upgrading.
The consultation runs until September before a full application is submitted to the council in October.
