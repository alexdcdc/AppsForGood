Zandra Elliot served as councillor for Hawick and Denholm from 2007 until her death last year.
She was one of the driving forces behind the Â£3.64m renovation of Wilton Lodge Park.
The bandstand was unveiled on Sunday by current provost Stuart Marshall.
The councillor said: "Zandra Elliot was a lady who lived and breathed the whole regeneration project at Wilton Lodge Park and working closely with her for many years, I know how passionate she was about having the bandstand in the park.
"She was a provost three times for the town and she worked tirelessly for Hawick so I can think of no better person to have this dedicated to."
