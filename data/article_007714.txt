Scarlets general manager of rugby, Jon Daniels, said: "Josh, Tom [Phillips] and Steff are all products of our development pathway.
"Our development is something we've always been proud of.
"Fifteen of the 23 players that took on Ospreys at Parc y Scarlets last week came through, or took some part, in the development pathway."
Flanker Macleod, 20, has enjoyed a breakthrough season for Scarlets, including a Champions Cup start against champions Saracens.
Former Wales Under-20 captain Phillips, 21, made his professional debut against Zebre in October 2015 and the blindside flanker has since gone on to make 14 appearances for the west Wales region.
Centre Hughes, 23, is another former Wales U20 captain and has battled back from a serious knee injury to make 17 appearances this season in the Champions Cup and Guinness Pro12.
Lock Price, 24, joined Scarlets in the summer of 2015 from Leicester Tigers, making his competitive debut in the season opener against Glasgow in September of the same year.
The 6ft 8in Wales-qualified second row has made 35 appearances for the Scarlets to date, scoring three tries.
"These four players join an exciting group who have already committed their futures to the region, alongside Steff Evans, Will Boyde, Dan Jones and Hadleigh Parkes as well as internationals Rob Evans, Samson Lee and Ken Owens," Daniels added.
Scarlets finished third in the Pro12 this season and play Leinster in Dublin on Friday night for a place in the end-of-season play-off final.
