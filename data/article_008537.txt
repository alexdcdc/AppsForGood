Over the course of four months starting last October, we asked American voters nationally what their impressions of each state are. Hawaii came out on top, by far, with California bringing up the rear. 
  
 Americans generally have a favorable view of most states. Only five are in negative territory, led by California (27% favorable and 44% unfavorable), Illinois (19-29), New Jersey (25-32), Mississippi (22-28), and Utah (24-27). Only seven other states have net-positive ratings in the single digits, and another breaks even (Louisiana). 
  
 54% see Hawaii positively and only 10% negatively, followed in the top ten by Colorado (44-9), Tennessee (48-14), South Dakota (42-8), Virginia (45-13), Montana (39-7), Alaska (46-17), Oregon (43-14), and North Carolina and Pennsylvania (each 40-11). Ten others are in positive territory by at least 21 points. 
  
 There are also some differences across demographic lines. Women have a higher opinion of New York by 27 points more than men, Massachusetts by 22 points, Delaware and California by 16, New Hampshire by 15, Vermont and Illinois by 13, and Connecticut by 11, while men see North Dakota more favorably by 17 points, South Carolina by 15, Wyoming 14, Montana 13, and Iowa and South Dakota 10. 
  
 Democrats’ favorite states include Hawaii (62-7), Washington (50-10), Massachusetts (49-9), Oregon (46-6), Vermont (46-9), Colorado (45-8), and New York (51-15), and their least favorites are led by Texas (17-51), Alabama (13-45), and Mississippi (13-41). Republicans love Alaska (65-3) and Texas (66-9), and absolutely hate California (12-68), followed distantly by Illinois (15-44) and Massachusetts (19-47). So the greatest partisan gap is for California, which Democrats like 91 points more than Republicans do, followed by Texas, which is favored more by Republicans by 82 points. 
  
 Black voters dislike 10 of the 14 Southern states. The only ones they like are North Carolina (their second favorite overall after Hawaii, at 42-8), Virginia (36-13), Tennessee (36-15), Maryland (32-13), and Florida (34-18). Their least favorite state overall is Alabama (14-56), then Mississippi (15-51), and Texas (17-44). 
  
 Full results here ||||| Texas is big, proud and … not really liked that much by people in other states, at least according to the results of a Public Policy Polling survey released Tuesday. 
  
 The state of Texas is many things, but when 1,200 Americans were asked for their opinion of Texas in the last several months, 31 percent responded unfavorably. The good news is that 40 percent responded favorably, but the difference in percentages wasn’t enough for the state to be viewed more positively than Hawaii. Or North Dakota. Or Rhode Island. 
  
 You get the idea. 
  
 The 9 percentage point difference in positive and negative opinions placed Texas at 38th most liked state among the 50 United States. 
  
 But however Texas is viewed, residents can take comfort in knowing Americans aren’t indifferent about its Lone Star. About forty to sixty percent of respondents answered “not sure” when asked about their opinions of most states. But only 29 percent were unsure whether they liked Texas or not – a credit to Texas’s distinct culture and style, said Mark P. Jones, chair of the Department of Political Science at Rice University. 
  
 “States like Texas, given that it’s a well known brand and elicits a lot of positive support, it also has high negatives,” Jones said. 
  
 The only state respondents had less of an opinion about was California with 28 percent – the most hated state on the list. 
  
 Some more findings from the survey: If you are black, you probably don’t like Texas as much as most other states, but it’s better than Mississippi or Alabama. If you are a Republican, you probably love Texas and hate California. (The reverse is true if you are a Democrat.) 
  
 Take heart, Texas – 25 million people can’t be wrong. You will always be the biggest (as long as you’re only counting the continental states because Alaska beats you by a lot.) You have a lot of oil and presidents and a really big water park. And people like you more than New Jersey. |||||
