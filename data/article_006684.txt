The Nottingham-based Scot executed her tactics brilliantly to stay in the top two throughout the race.
But the 25-year-old had to settle for silver behind South Korea's defending champion Minjeong Choi.
Christie then progressed to the 3,000m Super Final, finishing third to secure an overall world ranking of third.
"It didn't all go to plan at this championships but I am walking away with a silver and a bronze medal in the individuals and third place ranking overall," said Christie, who won four European gold medals in Sochi in January.
"It's brought a tough year to a close and now we will head back home, review the season and look for the elements to improve on next year."
Elsewhere, Jack Whelbourne went out in the 1,000m quarter-finals but finished ninth overall after placing fifth in the 500m and sixth in the 1500m on Saturday.
Charlotte Gilmartin failed to qualify for the 1,000m but a sixth place in the 500m and fourth in the 1500m left her 10th overall.
The team's overall performance means Great Britain will now qualify for three ladies positions at next year's World Championships.
"I'm really proud of the way the athletes performed," said Nicky Gooch, Christie's coach and head coach of GB Short Track.
"Charlotte Gilmartin has made big progress throughout the season and Jack Whelbourne has shown great resilience to overcome injury and perform with so little preparation.
"Although perhaps missing some opportunities to walk away with gold, Elise has still had the best World Championships of her career to date."
