It is one of thousands of items that belonged to the collapsed F1 team that are going under the hammer in a series of online sales.
The Banbury-based firm ceased trading in early November, nearly two weeks after being placed in administration.
A two-day live webcast auction started at 10:00 GMT. Items include show cars, team clothing and memorabilia.
Other items to sell so far include a 2010 steering wheel, which fetched £2,200 and a Timo Glock driver's suit and boots on a display mannequin, which raised £700.
Other items include boxes of merchandise, including hundreds of baseball caps, sections of car bodywork and wheels.
Two sales, on Thursday and 21 January, will feature furniture, computer equipment and 2013's F1 cars, minus their engines.
The webcast takes the form of a traditional auction with an auctioneer accepting bids, while the online timed sales will allow people to bid for items during a specific time.
Auctioneers have not put a reserve price on any of the items.
Administrators FRP Advisory confirmed last month Marussia had folded with the loss of 200 jobs after failed efforts to find a buyer.
The team became the second F1 outfit to be placed in administration in the autumn after the Caterham team also folded in October.
Marussia entered the sport under the Virgin Racing name in 2010. A change to the cars' chassis was needed because the fuel tank was too small and the team finished last in the constructors' championship.
The team rebranded as Marussia in 2012 and managed its first top-10 finish in the constructors' championship in 2013.
Marussia's final race was at the Russian Grand Prix on 12 October.
