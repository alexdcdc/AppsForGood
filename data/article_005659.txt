Mayor Marvin Rees said the planned opening date is now delayed until 2020.
The 12,000-seat venue near Temple Meads was originally due to have been finished by late 2017. A delay until 2019 was announced last year.
Mr Rees said he is "committed" to getting the arena built and "it remains closer than it has ever been".
Bristol City Council said it had been working with its preferred construction firm Bouygues UK to agree the final package of works and a target cost.
The cost of the project has been estimated at Â£92.5m, however the two sides have been unable to agree on price and will not be progressing to full contract.
The authority said it is now actively exploring other options to construct the arena "as quickly as possible".
