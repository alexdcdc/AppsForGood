The Rugby Football League has confirmed that Silverwood has been temporarily removed from his officiating duties.
An RFL statement read: "As an internal disciplinary measure, Richard Silverwood will not be considered until after the Grand Final at Old Trafford."
The Yorkshire official was stood down after an off-field incident at Huddersfield's game with Leeds.
Silverwood, 35, who refereed last year's Challenge Cup final, became Super League's youngest official when he took charge of his first game in 2001 at the age of just 24.
He was suspended by the RFL in February 2009 for what was described as an alleged breach of its information technology policy.
Phill Bentham will take Silverwood's place in charge of this Friday night's game between Huddersfield and Leeds, while Steve Ganson will take charge of Sunday's Wigan-Catalans clash.
