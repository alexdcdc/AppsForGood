It's been called the "happy hour" debate -- the 5 p.m. face-off that precedes the prime-time showdown among the top-polling Republican presidential candidates in Cleveland. 
  
 But the stakes for those invited to "happy hour" could be even higher. 
  
 Seven lower-polling candidates were invited to the 5 p.m. ET Fox News/Facebook debate stage. The smaller pond, it's an opportunity for at least one of the candidates to make a big splash -- and start the buzz that builds a fledgling bid into a serious campaign. 
  
 "An underdog is going to emerge from this first debate," Craig Shirley, a conservative strategist and Reagan biographer, said. 
  
 Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who flamed out of the 2012 race after an infamous debate gaffe, is looking for redemption. Former New York Gov. George Pataki, even though he won't be on the big stage with Donald Trump, appears poised to hammer the billionaire front-runner. Former HP exec Carly Fiorina has been blunt in saying that, as the only woman in the field, she would be a potent adversary against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.

 Any of the seven could have a break-out moment Thursday afternoon that catapults them into the upper mix of the 17 candidates now on the field. 
  
 Those invited to the 5 p.m. debate are: Perry; Pataki; Fiorina; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham; and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore. 
  
 JOIN THE DEBATE DISCUSSION 
  
 Pataki told Fox News the race right now is "all about name ID," with a "reality show host, a brother and son two of presidents" leading the field. He said he'll distinguish himself by his record as governor. 
  
 "I think I changed New York with sweeping conservative change more than any other state in America," he said. "Enough of the sound bites, enough of the posturing. Bring Americans together, governor successfully, solve our problems and move forward with confidence." 
  
 Like Trump, Fiorina also comes from a business background. But she told Fox News, "I've had a very different set of experiences than Donald Trump. I started out as a secretary, I went on eventually to lead the largest technology company in the world. So it's a very different experience set of working my way up."

 She said she knows more world leaders than anyone running save for maybe Clinton, "Only I didn't do photo ops, I wrestled with bureaucracies." 
  
 As for his debate plans, Santorum told Fox News on Thursday he plans to just be "authentic." 
  
 "I did this 22 times the last time around," said the former presidential candidate. 
  
 He said he'll be able to stand out by pointing to his legislative record as a former senator, fighting to ban partial-birth abortions, enact welfare reform and impose Iran sanctions. 
  
 "They're really isn't anybody else up there on the stage who has a record of accomplishment in Washington, D.C.," he said. 
  
 WATCH THE DEBATE ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE 
  
 Syndicated columnist and Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York wrote that the 5 p.m. debate provides opportunities for candidates for several reasons. Namely, Trump won't be on the stage dominating attention, it will be less personality-driven, and the winner of the debate will get momentum. 
  
 Shirley said he thinks the media want to essentially pick someone from the first debate to advance. "I think the first debate is not going to get as much attention but it might surprise everybody and be the most issue-oriented because of the distracting fight opening up between [Jeb] Bush and Trump in the second debate," he said. 
  
 Both debates, hosted by Fox News and Facebook in conjunction with the Ohio Republican Party, will be held at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. 
  
 The 9 p.m. ET debate will include the top 10 candidates in an average of recent national polls. They are Trump; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. |||||

 HEMMER: And former Virginia governor, Jim Gilmore. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Now, this debate will last one hour. We're going to have four commercial breaks. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Each candidate will have one minute to anwer each question and 30 seconds for rebuttal. If you run out of time, you're going to hear this. 
  
 OK? 
  
 HEMMER: Gentle. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Everybody got the bell? 
  
 HEMMER: Wait til you hear what the others are going to get later, huh? 
  
 MACCALLUM: Exactly. 
  
 (LAUGHTER) 
  
 HEMMER: One year from now, a Republican nominee will be standing on this stage in this very same arena. That person is in Cleveland today. 
  
 So let's get started. First topic, electability. 
  
 First question to Governor Perry from Texas. 
  
 Welcome, Governor. 
  
 PERRY: It's good to be with you. 
  
 HEMMER: You were in charge of the 12th largest economy in the world, and you recently said that four years ago, you weren't ready for this job. 
  
 HEMMER: Why should someone vote for you now? 
  
 PERRY: After those four years of looking back and being prepared, the preparation to be the most powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work: not just having been the governor of the 12th largest economy in the world, which I might add, we added 1.5 million jobs during that period of time over that 2007 through 2014 period, a period when America was going through the most deep recession it had been through since the Great Depression. 
  
 I think Americans want someone to have a track record of showing them how to get this country back on record, someone who will stand up and every day project that best days of America are in front of us. 
  
 And I will assure you, as the governor of the state of Texas, and as those last four years have shown me, the preparation to be ready to stand on this stage and talk about those monetary policies, those domestic policies, and those foreign policies, Americans are going to see that I am ready to be that individual. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Governor. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Now we go to Carly Fiorina. 
  
 Carly, you were CEO of Hewlett-Packard. You ran for Senate and lost in California in 2010. This week, you said "Margaret Thatcher was not content to manage a great nation in decline, and neither am I." 
  
 Given your current standings in the polls, is the Iron Lady comparison a stretch? 
  
 FIORINA: Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn't win, Ronald Reagan couldn't win, Bill Clinton couldn't win, and neither could've Barack Obama. 
  
 I started as a secretary and became ultimately the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world, almost $90 billion in over 150 countries. I know personally how extraordinary and unique this nation is. 
  
 I think to be commander in chief in the 21st century requires someone who understands how the economy works, someone who understands how the world works and who's in it; I know more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton; understands bureaucracies, how to cut them down to size and hold them accountable; and understands technology, which is a tool, but it's also a weapon that's being used against us. 
  
 Most importantly, I think I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time. But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status-quo and unlock the potential of others. We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again. 
  
 Thank you. 
  
 HEMMER: Senator Santorum, you won the Iowa caucus four years ago and 10 other states. But you failed to beat Mitt Romney for the nomination. And no one here tonight is going to question your conviction or your love for country. But has your moment passed, Senator? 
  
 SANTORUM: I would say the message that got us the win in Iowa and 10 other states against pretty overwhelming odds, is the message that's going to deliver us in this election. 
  
 SANTORUM: You know, we didn't start out four years ago at the top of the heap. We were behind where we were today. But we stuck to our message. We stuck to the fact that Americans are tired of Washington corporate interests and Democrats who are interested in just politics and power and they're looking for someone who's going to fight for them; looking for someone who's going to grow manufacturing sector of our economy, so those 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree have a chance to rise again. Someone who's going to stand up, and be very clear with our enemies as to the lines their going to draw and stand with them. 
  
 I've got a track record. The reason I did so well last time is not just because of the vision, it's because I have a track record in Washington, D.C. of getting things done. Iran sanctions -- the Iran sanctions that brought them to the table, those are sanctions that we put in place when I was in the United States Senate, and a whole host of other things that put me in a position of saying, I not only have a great vision, but I can govern effectively in Washington. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Senator. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Governor Jindal, you're one of two sitting governors on the stage tonight. But your approval numbers at home are in the mid 30s at this point. In a recent poll that showed you in a head-to- head against Hillary Clinton in Louisiana, she beat you by several points. 
  
 So if the people of Louisiana are not satisfied, what makes you think that the people of this nation would be? 
  
 JINDAL: Well, first of all, thank you all for having us. 
  
 You know, I won two record elections. Last time I was elected governor, won a record margin in my state. Martha, we got a lot of politicians that will kiss babies, cut ribbons, do whatever it takes to be popular. That's not why I ran for office. 
  
 I ran for office to make the generational changes in Louisiana. We've cut 26 percent of our budget. We have 30,000 fewer state bureaucrats than the day I took office. I don't think anybody has cut that much government anywhere, at any time. As a result, eight credit upgrades; as a result, a top ten state for private sector job creation. And we fought for statewide school choice, where the dollars follow the child, instead of the child following the dollars. We've been the most pro-life state six years in a row. My point is this: I won two landslide elections, I made big changes. I think our country is tired of the politicians who simply read the polls and fail to lead. Both Democrats and Republicans have gotten us in the mess we're in -- $18 trillion of debt, a bad deal with Iran, we're not staying with Israel. 
  
 I think the American people are look for real leadership. That's what I've done in Louisiana, that's what I'll do in America. 
  
 HEMMER: Senator Lindsey Graham, you worked with Democrats and President Obama when it came to climate change, something you know is extremely unpopular with conservative Republicans. 
  
 How can they trust you based on that record? 
  
 GRAHAM: You can trust me to do the following: that when I get on change with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, we'll be debating about the solutions. In her world, cap- and-trade would dominate, that we will destroy the economy in the name of helping the environment. In my world, we'll focus on energy independence and a clean environment. 
  
 When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less. Over time, we're going to become energy independent. I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts. The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America. 
  
 A healthy environment, a strong economy and energy independent America -- that would be the purpose of my presidency, is break the strangle hold that people enjoy on fossil fuels who hate our guts. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Senator. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Governor Pataki, four years ago this month, you called it quits in a race for the presidency in 2012, but now you're back. Mitt Romney declined to run this time, because he believed that the party needed new blood. 
  
 Does he have a point? 
  
 PATAKI: I think he means somebody who hasn't been a career politician, and who's been out of office for awhile. I think the last eight years in the private sector have allowed me to see government from the outside, and I think that is a positive thing. Yes, I thought about running four years ago. I was ready to lead, but I wasn't ready to run. 
  
 But I look at this country today, and I look at how divided we are, I look at how politicians are always posturing and issuing sound bites but never solving problems. What I did in New York was bring people together, an overwhelmingly Democratic state. But I was able to get Democrats to support the most conservative sweeping policy changes in any state in America. 
  
 And when I look at Washington today, we need to bring us together. We need to solve problems, we need to rebuild our military so we can stand up to radical Islam, we need to get our economy growing much faster by throwing out the corrupt tax code and lowering the rates. We have to end crony capitalism in Washington, where the lobbyists and the powerful can get tax breaks and tax credits, and the American people don't get laws in their interest. 
  
 I can do that. And I can do it regardless of what the makeup of Congress is because I did it in New York state. So we need new leadership -- yes. I will be that new leader. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor. 
  
 From one side of the stage, the other -- the other, Governor Jim Gilmore. 
  
 You were the last person on stage to declare your candidacy. You ran for the White House once and lost. You ran for the Senate one time and lost. You haven't held public office in 13 years. 
  
 Similar question, is it time for new blood? 
  
 GILMORE: I think the times are different now. I think the times are much more serious. 
  
 Because Obama and Clinton policies, the United States is moving further and further into a decline. I want to reverse that decline. That's why I've entered this race, and I think I have the experience to do it. 
  
 Former elected prosecutor, attorney general, governor, I was elected to all of those offices. 
  
 A person who, in fact, has a long experience in foreign-policy issues, which is different from many of the other governors and prospective governors who are running. I was an Army intelligence agent and a veteran during the Cold War, assigned to West Germany. 
  
 I was the chairman of the National Commission on Homeland Security and Terrorism for the United States for five years. I was a person who has dealt extensively with these homeland security issues. I was a governor during the 9/11 attack. 
  
 I understand both of these issues, how to build the economy and doing that as a governor who'd built jobs, had cut taxes and also a governor who understands foreign-policy, and that's why I entered this race. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Governor. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Alright, everybody. Now to the elephant that is not in the room tonight, Donald Trump. 
  
 Let's take a look at this graphic that shows the huge amount of political chatter that he is driving on Facebook right now, some of it good, probably, some of it bad. But he is dominating this conversation. Governor Perry, you two have been going at it. But given the large disparity in your poll numbers, he seems to be getting the better of you. 
  
 PERRY: Well, when you look at the celebrity of Donald Trump, then I think that says a lot about it. 
  
 One thing I like to remind people is, back in 2007, Rudy Giuliani was leading the polls for almost a year. I'll suggest a part of that was his celebrity. Fred Thompson was the other one, a man who had spent a lot of time on that screen. 
  
 I've had my issues with Donald Trump. I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who was using his celebrity rather than his conservatism. 
  
 How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single- payer health care? I mean, I ask that with all due respect. And nobody, nobody on either one of these stages has done more than I've done and the people of the State of Texas to deal with securing that border. 
  
 We sent our Texas ranger recon teams. We sent our parks and wildlife wardens. I deployed the National Guard after I stood on the ramp in Dallas, Texas and looked the president of the United States in the eye and said, "Mr. President, if you won't secure the border, Texas will," and that's exactly what we did. 
  
 We need a president that doesn't just talk a game, but a president that's got real results. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Alright, I want to ask that same question, because it's true, really, of all of you on this stage that, like it or not, Donald Trump is -- there's a huge disparity between the poll numbers that you have and the poll numbers that he has, given also the fact that Rudy Giuliani said he thought that there may be some Reagan qualities to Donald Trump. 
  
 So Carly Fiorina, is he getting the better of you? 
  
 FIORINA: Well, I don't know. I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn't. Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign. 
  
 Here's the thing that I would ask Donald Trump in all seriousness. He is the party's frontrunner right now, and good for him. 
  
 I think he's tapped into an anger that people feel. They're sick of politics as usual. You know, whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would resolved, the political class has failed you. That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into. 
  
 I would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern? 
  
 MACCALLUM: Thank you. 
  
 HEMMER: This Saturday, August 8th, two days from now marks one year since the strikes began against ISIS in Iraq and followed in Syria one month later. This week, a leading general in the U.S. Marine Corps says, "One year later, that fight is at a stalemate." 
  
 Governor Jindal, give me one example how your fight against ISIS would be different over there? 
  
 JINDAL: Well, to start with, unlike President Obama, I'll actually name the enemy that we confront. We've got a president who cannot bring himself to say the words "radical Islamic terrorism." 
  
 Now, Bill, he loves to criticize America, apologize for us, criticize medieval Christians. How can we beat an enemy if our commander-in-chief doesn't have the moral honesty and clarity to say that Islam has a problem, and that problem is radical Islam, to say they've got to condemn not generic acts of violence, but the individual murderers who are committing these acts of violence. 
  
 We've got a president who instead says, we're going to change hearts and minds. Well, you know what? Sometimes you win a war by killing murderous, evil terrorists. We're going to take the political handcuffs off the military. We will arm and train the Kurds. We will work with our Sunni allies. They know we will be committed to victory. 
  
 We had this failed red line with Assad and it discouraged folks that want to help us on the ground. Finally, we'll take off the political handcuffs. We'll go to the Congress. This president has gone to Congress and said give me a three-year deadline, give me a ban on ground troops. I'm going to go to the commanders and say give me a plan to win. You can't send your troops into harm's way unless you give them every opportunity to be successful. 
  
 HEMMER: And the senator to your right has called for 20,000 American troops in Syria and Iraq so far today, Senator Graham, and I'll give this question to you. Why should the American people after two wars in Iraq sacrifice yet again on a third war? 
  
 GRAHAM: If we don't stop them over there, they are coming here just as sure as I stand here in front of you. 
  
 One thing I want to be clear about tonight. If you're running for president of the United States and you don't understand that we need more American ground forces in Iraq and that America has to be part of a regional ground force that will go into Syria and destroy ISIL in Syria, then you're not ready to be commander in chief. And you're not serious about destroying ISIL. 
  
 According to the generals that I know and trust, this air campaign will not destroy ISIL. We need a ground force in Iraq and Syria, and America has to be part of that ground force. According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation. I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL. Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them. 
  
 HEMMER: Senator, thank you. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. Let's get to our first commercial break. There is plenty more to discuss tonight. Coming up, immigration, more on ISIS and homeland security as well as we continue live tonight from Cleveland, Ohio. 
  
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
  
 HEMMER: It is debate night, and welcome back to Cleveland, Ohio. Let's get back to the questions right now with Martha. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. Let's talk about ISIS and the threat to the homeland that we have seen growing in recent months. This goes to Governor Pataki. 
  
 Sixty-nine ISIS-inspired terrorists have been arrested in this country, in homeland plots, and the FBI assures us that there are likely many more to come. 
  
 The president is reluctant to label these terrorists Islamic extremists, but you've said that you have no problem with that label. Then comes the hard part. 
  
 So here's the question. How far are you willing to go to root out this problem here at home? Would you put mosques, for example, potentially, under surveillance? And keep in mind that conservatives are increasingly concerned in this country with religious liberty. 
  
 PATAKI: Martha, religious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad and kill an American here. That is not protected free speech. That is not protected religious belief. 
  
 That is like shouting "fire" in a crowded theater, and that is illegal, and I would do everything in our power not just to go after those who are here who we know who are here, before they can radicalize other Americans to carry out attacks, and it's not just the ones they've arrested. 
  
 Think back to Garland, Texas. But for that Texas police officer, we could have had a mass murder. We have to shut down their internet capability. We have to shut down, whether or not they're in prisons preaching or on -- in mosques preaching. No radical Islam that is allowed to engage in encouraging violence against Americans, that is not protected speech. 
  
 Let me just add one thing about ISIS over there. We have got to destroy their training camps and recruiting centers. 
  
 I was governor of New York on September 11. I know that we are at greater risk today than at any time since then of another attack. We have got to destroy their training camps over there before they can attack us here. 
  
 I don't agree that we're going to occupy and spend another decade or a trillion dollars. What we need to do is destroy their ability to attack us here over there, and then get out. 
  
 You know, I have two sons. Both served. One as a marine officer in Iraq, one as an army officer in Afghanistan. I do not see -- want to see one parent or loved one worrying about getting a call in the middle of the night. 
  
 I would not place one American life at risk unless it was absolutely necessary. But to destroy ISIS, it is necessary. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. This question to Carly Fiorina. The FBI director Comey says that terrorists can thrive here at home because they go dark and they recruit behind the cyber walls that are built by American companies like Google and Apple. 
  
 Comey says this is a big problem. Rand Paul says that the government forcing these companies to bring down those walls would be a big privacy issue and a dangerous way to go on this. You've been a tech leader in this country. Which side are you on? 
  
 FIORINA: Let me say first that it is disturbing that every time one of these home-grown terrorist attacks occurs, and, as your question points out, they are occurring with far too great frequency, it turns out we had warning signals. 
  
 It turns out we knew something was wrong. It turns out some dot wasn't connected, and so the first thing we have to do is make sure that everyone and every responsible agency is attuned to all of these possibilities and symptoms. 
  
 We even had warnings about the Boston Marathon bombers, and yet the dots weren't connected. So we need to get on a different mindset. 
  
 Secondly, I certainly support that we need to tear down cyber walls, not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis. But let me just say that we also need down -- to tear down the cyber walls that China is erecting, that Russia is erecting. 
  
 FIORINA: We need to be very well aware of the fact that China and Russia are using technology to attack us, just as ISIS is using technology to recruit those who would murder American citizens. I do not believe that we need to wholesale destroy every American citizen's privacy in order to go after those that we know are suspect or are -- are already a problem. But yes, there is more collaboration required between private sector companies and the public sector. And specifically, we know that we could have detected and repelled some of these cyber attacks if that collaboration had been permitted. A law has been sitting -- languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill and has not yet been passed, and it would help. 
  
 MACCALLUM: So, would you tonight call for Google and Apple to cooperate in these Investigations and let the FBI, in where they need to go? 
  
 FIORINA: I absolutely would call on them to collaborate and cooperate, yes. 
  
 HEMMER: Excuse me, Martha. I have not heard the bell just yet, so you're all very well behaved so far. 
  
 Governor Gilmore, 30 seconds. 
  
 GILMORE: Well, yes, indeed. I chaired the National Commission on Homeland Security Committee for United States. We warned about the 9/11 attack before the 9/11 attack occurred. I was the governor during the 9/11 attack when the Pentagon was struck. 
  
 And I'm going to tell you this, we need to use the benefit of our law enforcement people across this country, combined with our intelligence people across this country. We need to use our technological advantages, because what we've warned of is an international guerrilla movement that threatens this country. It's going to happen in this country, there are going to be further attacks. 
  
 We have to be prepared to defend the American people, prepare them for a long war, stand up for the defense of this country, and stand up for the values of this country... 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Governor. I've got to move on to immigration here. 
  
 Senator Santorum, you would argue you have one of the tougher positions on illegal immigration in the entire 17 candidate field at the moment. We often talk about this issue on the abstract level in Washington, D.C., but you know how it's being talked about in states like Iowa and New Hampshire among illegals in our country today -- 11 million plus. 
  
 And some are asking, what would you say to a child, born and raised in America, who could see their family broken apart by your policy? 
  
 SANTORUM: My father was born in Italy, and shortly after he was born my grandfather immigrated to this country. And under the laws of this country, he wasn't allowed to be with his father for seven years. Spent the first seven years of his life in Fascist Italy, under Benito Mussolini. Not a very pleasant place to be. 
  
 I asked my dad after -- obviously, when I found out about this. And I said, "Didn't you resent America for not letting you be with your father in those formative and very threatening years?" You know what he said to me? "America was worth the wait." 
  
 We're a country of laws, Bill. We're a country of laws, not of men, not of people who do whatever they want to do. I know we have a president who wants to do whatever he wants to do, and take his pen and his phone and just tell everybody what he thinks is best. But the reason America is a great country, the reason is because our compassion is in our laws. And when we live by those laws and we treat everybody equally under the law, that's when people feel good about being Americans. 
  
 And I put forth an immigration policy that is as strong in favor of the folks who are struggling in America the most than anybody else. It's the strongest pro-worker immigration plan. It says that after 35 million people have come here over the last 20 years, almost all of whom are unskilled workers, flattening wages, creating horrible opportunity -- a lack of opportunities for unskilled workers, we're going to do something about reducing the level of immigration by 25 percent. 
  
 We're going to be tough at the border, we're going to be tough on all of the illegal immigrants that everybody else in this field -- we're going to be different. We're going to be actually out there trying to create a better life for hard-working Americans. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor Perry, try and answer this question again. 
  
 What do you say to the family of illegals? Are you going to break them apart? 
  
 PERRY: Bill, here's the interesting position on this. Americans are tired of hearing this debate -- want to go to, what are you going to do about illegal immigration? For 30 years this country has been baited with that. All the way back to when Ronald Reagan signed a piece of legislation that basically allowed for amnesty for over 4 million people, and the border is still not secure. 
  
 The American people are never going to trust Washington, D.C., and for good reason. We hear all this discussion about well, I would do this, or I would do that, when the fact is, the border is still porous. Until we have a president of the United States that gets up every day and goes to the Oval Office with the intent purpose of securing that border, and there's not anybody on either one of these stages that has the experience of dealing with this as I have for over 14 years with that 1200-mile border. 
  
 PERRY: We have to put the personnel on that border in the right places; you have to put the strategic fencing in place; and you have to have aviation assets that fly all the way from Tijuana to El Paso to Brownsville, Texas -- 1,933 miles looking down 24/7, with the technology to be able to identify what individuals are doing, and ID when they are in obviously illegal activities or suspicious activities, and quick response teams come. 
  
 At that particular point in time, then Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until. 
  
 If you elect me president of the United States, I will secure that southern border. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor, thank you. 
  
 MACCALLUM: On that note, next, the candidates take on the future of the U.S. economy when we come back after this quick break. 
  
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
  
 MACCALLUM: Welcome back, everybody. It is the bottom of the hour, and we are back, live from Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, kicking off the first 2016 Republican primary debate. 
  
 HEMMER: And so right now, we're 30 minutes in. Going to jump back into the topics and continue our discussion of national issues on the domestic level. 
  
 The issue that is really number one on the minds of many voters, that's the economy and jobs. 
  
 MACCALLUM: So let's start here with Senator Graham. 
  
 Senator Graham, 82 million Americans over the age of 20 are out of the workforce. 
  
 GRAHAM: Right. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Forty-five million people in this country are on food stamps. Nine million are on disability. 
  
 All of these numbers have been rising sharply in recent years. 
  
 There is an increasing willingness in this country to accept assistance. How do you get Americans who are able to take the job instead of a handout? 
  
 GRHAAM: I think America is dying to work, you just need to give them a chance. To all the Americans who want a better life, don't vote for Hillary Clinton. You're not going to get it. She's not going to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it. I will. She's not going to build the Keystone Pipeline. I will. She's not going to change Dodd-Frank. I will. 
  
 Until you change the policies of Barack Obama, we're never going to grow this economy. Until you change the policies of Barack Obama, we're never going to be safe. She represents a third term of a failed presidency. 
  
 I'm fluent in Clinton-speak; I've been dealing with this crowd for 20 years. You know, when Bill Clinton says it depends on what the meaning of is is, that means is is whatever Bill wants it to mean. When Hillary Clinton tells you I've given you all the emails you need, that means she hasn't. So to the people who are dying for a better America, you better change course, and she doesn't represent the change that we need. 
  
 Do we all agree that ISIL is not the JV team? If I have to monitor a mosque, I'll monitor a mosque. If I have to take down a cyber wall, I'll take it. If I have to send more American troops to protect us here, I will do it. She will not. She has empowered a failed agenda. She is going to empower a failed solution to an American economy dying to grow. 
  
 Elect me, I know the difference between being flat broke. Apparently, she doesn't. In Hillary Clinton's world, after two terms in the White House where her husband was president, she said she was flat broke. Hillary, I'll show you flat broke. That's not it. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. Senator Santorum, let's get back to the question at hand, which is whether or not Americans have become too reliant on assistance or too willing to take assistance. Do you believe that we need to change the culture in this country in terms of whether or not we should be encouraging people to get off of it and take the job when it's available? Some are able and not doing that. 
  
 SANTORUM: I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a one-two punch. Number one, we have to create better paying jobs. I mean, that's just the bottom line. We haven't. And that's the reason that I've said under my presidency, we'll create jobs and make American the number one manufacturing country in the world. 
  
 If we want to create jobs for the folks that you're talking about, who are having trouble getting off government benefits, primarily because of their low skill level, there is no better way -- it's worked for 100 years in America -- putting people back to work in manufacturing is it. 
  
 I'm going to be introducing a plan which I call the 2020 Perfect Vision for America. It's a 20 percent flat rate tax, it'll take a blowtorch to the -- to the IRS. It will create a manufacturing juggernaut in this country. And you combine that with reforms of our welfare system. 
  
 You're looking at the -- at the man who introduced and fought on the floor as a freshman senator and passed the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 over two President Clinton vetoes. Got 70 votes in the United States Senate. Bipartisan issue. And I ended a federal entitlement. Never been done before, never been done since. 
  
 What we need to do is take the rest of the federal entitlements, not just welfare, but food stamps and Medicaid and housing programs and do the same thing we did with welfare. Work requirements and time limits. That will change everything. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. New question, same topic, goes to Governor Gilmore. You know, based on your record and what we're discussing here, which is potentially cutting back some entitlement, cutting back benefits, it's tricky business as we all know because people will argue that that's their means to escape poverty. So they're going to look at you when you want to do that and they will call you heartless. What will you tell them? 
  
 GILMORE: I'll tell them that we're going to grow the economy so that we can give people better opportunities so they don't have to rely exclusively on benefit types of programs. Some do, but many Americans are dying to have an opportunity to grow and to create something inside this economy. And I'm glad that I have a chance to answer this question. 
  
 I've had the growth code (ph) there for about five years, and it's this specific program. We're going to do a tax cut for all Americans. We're going to have a three-bracket tax code, 10, 15 and 25 percent. We're going to combine all commercial activity in business into one place in the tax code and charge it 15 percent, which is going to suddenly make us competitive with the rest of the world. And we're going to eliminate the death tax. 
  
 GILMORE: With a couple of additional tweaks, we know what this will do. It will cause the economy to grow, to explode, to create more jobs. And first of all, we've got to recognize that there is problem that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have caused. And that problem is too big regulations like the EPA, too much new taxes on business that we have seen and "Obamacare." These are drags on the economy, it's a deliberate drag. I propose to reverse that and get this economy moving again. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Governor. 
  
 Your last topic brings us to the state of Ohio. 
  
 You know, the saying, right? No Republican wins the White House unless you win here in the Buckeye state. Well, here in the Buckeye state, the Governor John Kasich took the federal money for Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. 
  
 And Governor Jindal of Louisiana, you passed on those tax dollars. Why do you think Governor Kasich got it wrong here? 
  
 JINDAL: Well, this goes to the question you were just asking. Look, under President Obama and Secretary Clinton, they're working hard to change the American dream into the European nightmare. They do celebrate more dependence on the government. 
  
 Give Bernie Sanders credit. At least he's honest enough to call himself a socialist. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they're no better. If we were to expand Medicaid, for every uninsured person we would cover, we'd kick more than one person out of private insurance or remove their opportunity to get private insurance. 
  
 We're going to have too many people in the cart rather than pulling the cart. This isn't free money. I know some people like to say, "well, this is free money." We pay federal taxes. We are borrowing money from China today. 
  
 Yesterday, the president stunningly admitted this. He said, "we don't have leverage with China to get a better deal on Iran because we need them to lend us money to continue operating our government." 
  
 The president of the United States admitting that he's weakening our government's position, our foreign policy standing, because he can't control spending in D.C.. 
  
 There is a better way to provide health care. The Oregon study showed this. Simply expanding Medicaid does not improve health care outcomes. In Louisiana, instead we're helping people getting better paying jobs so they can provide for their own health care. 
  
 HEMMER: So Governor Kasich was wrong, just to be clear. 
  
 JINDAL: I don't -- look, I don't think anybody should be expanding Medicaid. I think it's a mistake to create new and more expensive entitlement programs when we can't afford the ones we've got today. We've got to stop this culture of government dependence. 
  
 HEMMER: I didn't hear an answer regarding Governor Kasich, but for now I'll go to Governor Pataki. Yes or no? 
  
 JINDAL: I'll say this. I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid. I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere in Ohio and across the country. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor Pataki, three term governor of New York. Is he right, Governor Jindal from Louisiana? 
  
 PATAKI: I think he is right. I don't think you expand entitlements when so many people are dependent on government and when the money the federal government is offering is going to be taken away from you after just a couple of years. 
  
 But getting back to Martha's question about how we end dependency, do we have to have a cultural change? The answer is no. And I know this, because when I ran for governor of New York, one in 11 of every man, woman, and child in the state of New York was on welfare. On welfare. Think about that. 
  
 And people said "you can't win, you can't change the culture." But I knew that good people who wanted to be a part of the American dream have become trapped in dependency because the federal government and the state government had made it in their economic interest not to take a job because the benefits that they didn't work were better. 
  
 I changed that. We put in place mandatory work fair (ph). But we allowed people to keep health care. We put in place child care support. 
  
 HEMMER: Yes or no, would you have expanded Obamacare in the state of New York, had you been governor at that time? 
  
 PATAKI: No, it should be repealed. And by the way, when I left, there were over 1 million fewer people on welfare in New York state than when I took office... 
  
 HEMMER: OK. 
  
 PATAKI: ... replacing dependency with opportunity. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Governor Pataki. 
  
 In a moment here, we'll talk to the candidates about an issue today on Planned Parenthood, and also the U.S. Supreme Court. That's all next here in Cleveland. 
  
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
  
 HEMMER: Welcome back to Cleveland, Ohio. Want to get back to the questions and the issues in this debate now, with my co-anchor, Martha. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. 
  
 Well, there's been a lot of discussion on Facebook, as you would imagine, about the Iran nuclear deal. Let's just take a look, as an opener, at this one question that comes from Logan Christopher Boyer of St. Louis, Missouri. 
  
 He says, "How will you disarm Iran and keep the Middle East from becoming nuclearized? 
  
 So let's open this discussion about Iran with this question that comes to Governor Perry. Governor Perry, here's the question for you: 
  
 Critics of the Iran deal say that it puts America on the same side as the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the backers of those groups of people who chant 'Death to America,' in the street, that this deal puts on that side of the equation. 
  
 But our traditional Middle East allies, led by Saudi Arabia, have also funneled support to Islamic radical groups who want to kill Americans. 
  
 So which side do you believe we should be on? 
  
 PERRY: We need to be on the side that keeps Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. That's the side we need to be on, and that's the side of the bulk of the -- of the Middle East. 
  
 We need to have some coalitions in that part of the world to go after ISIS, but we also need to send a clear message. And hopefully -- you know, Senator Graham, I -- I know where he's going to be on this, but we use Congress, and we use Congress to cut this funding. 
  
 One of the great challenges that we have, $150 billion is fixing to go to a country that killed our Marines in Lebanon, that used their weapons to kill our young men in Iran. And the idea that this negotiation -- I will tell you one thing. I would a whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry. Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away. 
  
 But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but "Hell no" to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror, Susan Rice has said that, and we need to stand up and strongly and clearly tell the ayatollah that -- whoever the next president of the United States is going to be, and I'll promise you, if it's me, the first thing that I will do is tear up that agreement with Iran. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Alright. I want to go to Carly Fiorina on this, but I want to ask you some of what I just asked to Governor Perry. 
  
 The issue is that the allies that we are with sometimes have groups within them that funnel money to terrorists as well. This is a complicated situation. Are you OK with us being on their side? 
  
 FIORINA: Yeah. Sometimes it's a complicated situation, but some things are black and white. 
  
 On day one in the Oval Office, I would make two phone calls. The first one would be to my good friend, Bibi Netanyahu, to reassure him we will stand with the State of Israel. 
  
 The second will be to the supreme leader of Iran. He might not take my phone call, but he would get the message, and the message is this: Until you open every nuclear and every military facility to full, open, anytime/anywhere, for real, inspections, we are going to make it as difficult as possible for you to move money around the global financial system. 
  
 FIORINA: I hope Congress says no to this deal. But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing. 
  
 China and Russia have never been on our side of the table. The Europeans have moved on. We have to stop the money flow. And by the way, as important as those two phone calls are, they are also very important because they say this. America is back in the leadership business. And when America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place. 
  
 This is a bad deal. Obama broke every rule of negotiation. Yes, our allies are not perfect. But Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxies. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Very, very briefly, would you help our allies in that region to get nuclear weapons if Iran has them? 
  
 FIORINA: Let me tell you what I would do immediately, day two in the Oval Office. I would hold a Camp David summit with our Arab allies, not to talk them into this lousy deal with Iran, but to say to them, "what is it that you need to defeat ISIL?" 
  
 You know, Obama has presented the American people with a false choice every time. It's what I've done or not done, or it's war. It is a false choice. 
  
 King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a long time, has been asking for bombs and materiel. We have not provided them. He has gone to China. 
  
 The Kurds have been asking us to arm them for three years. We haven't done so. 
  
 The Egyptians have asked us to share intelligence. We're not doing it. We have Arab allies. 
  
 They are not perfect. I know every one. But they need to see leadership, support and resolve from the United States of America, and we can help them defeat ISIS. 
  
 HEMMER: Next question on the U.S. Supreme Court. It's been 42 years, Senator Santorum, since Roe v. Wade, and many consider, in this country, to be a case of settled law. 
  
 Recently the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on same-sex marriage. Is that now settled law in America today? SANTORUM: It is not any more than Dred Scott was settled law to Abraham Lincoln, who, in his first inaugural address, said "it won't stand." And they went ahead and passed laws in direct contravention to a rogue Supreme Court. 
  
 This is a rogue Supreme Court decision, just like Justice Roberts said. There is no constitutional basis for the Supreme Court's decision, and I know something about this. 
  
 The -- one of the times the Supreme Court spoke that I thought they were acting outside of their authority was in a partial-birth abortion case. You know, these Planned Parenthood tapes, what they're showing are partial-birth abortions. 
  
 Abortions being done where the baby's being delivered first, to preserve those organs, and then they crush the skull. Well, the Supreme Court found a bill that I was the author of unconstitutional. 
  
 What did I do? I didn't stop. I didn't say "oh, well we lost. It's the law of the land." We worked together. The House and Senate, under my leadership, and we passed a bill, and we said, "Supreme Court, you're wrong." 
  
 We're a coequal branch of the government. We have every right to be able to stand up and say what is constitutional. We passed a bill, bipartisan support, and the Supreme Court, they -- they sided with us. 
  
 Sometimes it just takes someone to lead and stand up to the court. 
  
 HEMMER: Alright, Senator, thank you. 
  
 To Governor Gilmore. For years, presidential candidates have not said they would have a litmus test for justices nominated to the Supreme Court. 
  
 Recently, Hillary Clinton broke that precedent. She said she would apply that on the case of Citizens United, which deals with campaign finance laws in America today. 
  
 Is it time for conservatives to impose a litmus test on abortion? 
  
 GILMORE: Well, as you know, I'm a former elected prosecutor, a former elected attorney general, trained at the University of Virginia in constitutional law, and I don't believe in litmus tests except this. 
  
 I believe we should be appointing Supreme Court justices who will follow the law and not try to make the law. Now, the challenge we're seeing today is that the Supreme Court is being converted into some type of political body. 
  
 They have to have some legal basis and precedence for being able to follow the law instead of making the law up, and my goal is -- in appointing Supreme Court justices, would be to point -- to appoint justices who would follow the law. Bill, I want to say one more thing about... 
  
 HEMMER: So, no litmus test? 
  
 GILMORE: Not -- not on that, no. But let me say one more thing. I want to -- before my time runs out I want to get back to this issue of ISIS versus Iran. It is Iran that's the expansionist power. ISIL is trying to create themselves into a new state. 
  
 Our job has to be to recognize the conflict between the two. I have proposed there be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there to stand up to Iranian expansion, and at the same time join together to begin to stop and this ISIL thing before it becomes an actual state. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, governor. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. With that, we are going to take a quick break. We'll be right back with much more from Cleveland. Stay with us. 
  
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
  
 HEMMER: As the first debate of the nomination season continues, welcome back to Cleveland. Let's get back to the questions right now, and the issues here in the U.S. 
  
 Martha? 
  
 MACCALLUM: We want to get back to Planned Parenthood. And this question goes to Governor Pataki. 
  
 Governor Pataki, you're the only pro-choice candidate running. A Republican holding that position has not won a single primary in 35 years. With the recent Planned Parenthood videos that we have all seen, shedding new light on abortion practices, I know that you have said that you would defund Planned Parenthood. 
  
 PATAKI: Yes. 
  
 MACCALLUM: But has this story changed your heart when it comes to abortion? 
  
 PATAKI: My heart has not changed, because I've always been appalled by abortion. I'm a Catholic, I believe life begins at conception. But as Bill said earlier, Roe v. Wade, it's has been the law for 42 years, and I don't think we should continue to try to change it. 
  
 But we can do is defund Planned Parenthood, and by the way, put in place an absolute permanent ban on any taxpayer dollars ever being used to fund abortions. Also, when you look at these videos, they are horrific and show just a hideous disrespect for life. What else we can do is that we should believe in science. 
  
 PATAKI: You know, Hillary Clinton's always saying how Republicans don't follow science? Well, they're the ones not listening to the scientists today, because doctors say that at 20 weeks that is a viable life inside the womb. And at that point, it's a life that we have the right to protect, and I think we should protect. 
  
 So, I would pass legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks. It is Hillary, it is Biden, it is the others who insist on allowing abortion well into viable (inaudible) wrong, and that should be stopped. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. 
  
 On the same topic, let's go to Governor Jindal. 
  
 Carly Fiorina, also on the stage, said that she would go so far as to shut down the government over the issue of defunding Planned Parenthood. Would you do that? Would you be willing to shut down the government when it comes to defunding this group? 
  
 JINDAL: Well, a couple of things. Planned Parenthood had better hope that Hillary Clinton wins this election, because I guarantee under President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood. 
  
 This is absolutely disgusting, and revolts the conscience of the nation. Absolutely, we need to defund Planned Parenthood. In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate. We just, earlier this week, kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract. They don't provide any abortions in Louisiana. 
  
 But in terms of shutting down the government, I don't think President Obama should choose to shut down the government simply to send taxpayer dollars to this group that has been caught, I believe, breaking the law, but also offending our values and our ethics. 
  
 It is time for Republicans in D.C. to fight. Too often, they give up, they negotiate with themselves. They said they would get rid of the unconstitutional amnesty. They didn't do that. They said they would repeal Obamacare if we gave them the majority. They didn't do that either. They said they'd shrink and balance the budget. They haven't done that. Absolutely, they should fight to fund -- defund Planned Parenthood, and I don't think the president should shut down the government simply to send our taxpayer dollars to this group. 
  
 MACCALLUM: All right. 
  
 Lindsey Graham, this conversation will no doubt go to the war on women, and that cutting funding to this group could be a very broad brush against all of you or anybody who will hold this nomination as being against women's health, against these organizations that people will say provide positive things for many women. 
  
 GRAHAM: I don't think it's a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies. Let's take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women's health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn. The only way we're going to defund Planned Parenthood is have a pro-life president. 
  
 You want to see a war on women? Come with me to Iraq and Afghanistan, folks. I've been there 35 times. I will show you what they do to women. These mythical Arab armies that my friends talk about that are going to protect us don't exist. If I am president of the United States, we're going to send soldiers back to Iraq, back to Syria, to keep us from being attacked here and keep soldiers in Afghanistan because we must. 
  
 I cannot tell you how much our nation is threatened and how we need a commander in chief who understands the threats to this nation. 
  
 If you're running for president of the United States and you do not understand that we cannot defend this nation without more of our soldiers over there, you are not ready for this job. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Senator. 
  
 Executive power. It appears that you all have a little bit of an issue with it at the moment. I want to move through this as quickly as I can, from stage left to stage right. 
  
 On the second day of his presidency, January 22nd 2009, President Obama signed one of his first executive orders. That was close Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Still open today. What would be your first executive order? 
  
 Governor Gilmore, start. 
  
 GILMORE: Well, it's not a matter of what the first executive order would be, Bill. The matter is what orders exist now that shouldn't exist? 
  
 The president has done an executive order with respect to illegal immigration that is illegal. Illegal. And it creates a -- a contempt for the law, for the rule of law. If i were the president of the United States, I would go and look at every executive order that exists right now and determine which ones want to be voided, because the president shouldn't be legislating: not through that vehicle or any other. We should be relying upon the leadership of the Congress to pass the laws. 
  
 HEMMER: Senator Graham. 
  
 GRAHAM: Change the Mexico City policy, not take one dime of taxpayer money to fund abortion organizations overseas, and restore the NSA that's been gutted. We're going dark when it comes to detecting the next attack. We have gutted our ability to detect the next attack. And I would not stand for that as president of the United States. I would take the fight to these guys, whatever it took, as long as it took. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor Jindal, your first executive order would be in the White House would be what? 
  
 JINDAL: To repeal these unconstitutional illegal orders, whether it's amnesty or whether it's this president going around the Congress, whether it's in Obamacare, to restore the rule of law. I'd also go after these sanctuary cities, do everything we can to make sure that we are not -- that we are actually prosecuting and cutting off funding for cities that are harboring illegal aliens, and then finally making sure the IRS is not going after conservative or religious groups. 
  
 I would sign an executive order protecting religious liberty, our first amendment rights, so Christian business owners and individuals don't face discrimination for having a traditional view of marriage. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor Perry. 
  
 PERRY: It'll be a pretty busy day, but that Iran negotiation is going to be torn up on day one. We're going to start the process of securing that border. I'm also going to take a bottle of White-Out with me to get started on all those executive orders that Mr. Obama has put his name to. 
  
 HEMMER: That will be a long day. 
  
 PERRY: It will be a long day. 
  
 HEMMER: Senator Santorum? 
  
 SANTORUM: Just ditto to that. 
  
 We're going to suspend -- I've -- I've said this for four years. We're going to suspend and repeal every executive order, every regulation that cost American jobs and is -- is -- is impacting our freedom. 
  
 And second, the First Amendment Defense Act, which is protecting religious liberty, if it's not passed by then, which I suspect it won't, because the president will veto it, I will institute an executive order to make sure that people of faith are not being -- not being harassed and persecuted by the federal government for standing up for the religious beliefs. 
  
 HEMMER: First order, Carly Fiorina? 
  
 FIORINA: I agree with my colleagues. We need to begin by undoing -- I would begin by undoing a whole set of things that President Obama has done, whether it's illegal amnesty or this latest round of EPA regulations. But let me go back to something that's very important. We have been debating right here the core difference between conservatism and progressivism. 
  
 Conservatives, I am a conservative because I believe no one of us is any better than any other one of us. Every one of us is gifted by God, whether it is those poor babies being picked over or it's someone whose life is tangled up in a web of dependence. 
  
 Progressives don't believe that. They believe some are smarter than others, some are better than others, so some are going to need to take care of others. 
  
 That is the fight we have to have, and we have to undo a whole set of things that President Obama has done that get at the heart of his disrespect and disregard for too many Americans. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor Pataki? 
  
 PATAKI: Bill, I defeated Mario Cuomo. In the first day in office, my first executive order, I revoked every one of the executive orders that he had -- he had enacted over the prior 12 years. I would do that to Barack Obama's executive orders. 
  
 But I'd sign a second one, as I did in New York, as well, having a hard hiring freeze on adding new employees except for the military or defense-related positions. I'd sign that executive order. 
  
 When I left the workforce, New York State had been reduced by over 15 percent. We can do that in Washington. I will do that in Washington. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you all. 
  
 MCCALLUM: Moving on to the next question, President Obama promised hope and change for the country, yet 60 percent of Americans are not satisfied with the shape that the country is in right now. Many think that America has lost its "can do" spirit and that it's not the nation that it once was. 
  
 Ronald Reagan was confronted with a similar atmosphere, and he said that it could be morning in America again. JFK said it was a new frontier. FDR said that we had nothing to fear but fear itself. 
  
 On this level, Carly Fiorina, can you inspire this nation? 
  
 FIORINA: This is a great nation. It is a unique nation in all of human history and on the face of the planet, because here, our founders believed that everyone has a right to fulfill their potential and that that right --they called it life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- comes from God and cannot be taken away by government. 
  
 We have arrived at a point in our nation's history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans is being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government, and only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation. 
  
 I will do that. 
  
 MCCALLUM: We're talking about tapping into historic levels of leadership and lifting the nation in this kind of way that we're discussing. 
  
 So Senator Santorum, how would you do it? 
  
 SANTORUM: I came to Washington, D.C. in 1990. That sounds like a long time ago. It was. It was 25 years ago, and I came by defeating the Democratic incumbent. I came as a reformer. 
  
 I started the Gang of Seven, and it led to the overtaking of the 40-year Democratic rule of Congress, because I didn't -- I stood up to the old-boy network in Washington, D.C. because I believed that Washington was not the solution, that Washington was the problem, just like Ronald Reagan said. I was a child of Ronald Reagan. 
  
 And I went there, and for 16 years, I fought the insiders and was able to get things done. That's the difference. We need to elect someone who will stand with the American people, who understands its greatness, who understands what an open economy and freedom is all about, but at the same time, has a record of being able to get things done in Washington like we've never seen before. 
  
 Reforms, everything from moral and cultural issues to economic issues. Those of you health savings accounts. Health savings accounts are something that we introduced. It's a private-sector solution that believes in freedom, not Obamacare that believes in government control. 
  
 SANTORUM: Those are the things we brought, and we were able to get things done. If you want someone who's not going to divide Washington, but gets things done, then you should make me your president. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, senator. 
  
 MACCALLUM: (inaudible) Lindsey Graham? 
  
 GRAHAM: Thank you. 
  
 First thing I'd tell the American people, whatever it takes to defend our nation, I would do. 
  
 To the 1 percent who have been fighting this war for over a decade, I'd try my best to be a commander-in-chief worthy of your sacrifice. 
  
 We're going to lose Social Security and Medicare if Republicans and Democrats do not come together and find a solution like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill. I will be the Ronald Reagan if I can find a Tip O'Neill. 
  
 When I was 21, my mom died. When I was 22, my dad died. We owned a liquor store, restaurant, bar and we lived in the back. Every penny we needed from -- every penny we got from Social Security, because my sister was a minor, we needed. Today, I'm 60, I'm not married, I don't have any kids. I would give up some Social Security to save a system that Americans are going to depend on now and in the future. 
  
 Half of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check. If you make your president, I'm going to put the country ahead of the party. I'm going to do what it takes to defend this nation. This nation has been great to me, and that's the only way I know to pay you back. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Thank you. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Senator. I need a two-word answer to the following query. In 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama described Hillary Clinton as, quote, "likable enough," end quote. What two words would you use to describe the Democratic frontrunner? Governor Pataki to start. 
  
 PATAKI: Divisive and with no vision. No vision at all. HEMMER: Wow. Carly Fiorina. 
  
 FIORINA: Not trustworthy. No accomplishment. 
  
 UNKNOWN: Secretive and untrustworthy. 
  
 PERRY: Well, let's go with three. Good at email. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor Jindal? 
  
 JINDAL: Socialist and government dependent. 
  
 GRAHAM: Not the change we need at a time we need it. 
  
 HEMMER: Governor? 
  
 GILMORE: Professional politician that can't be trusted. 
  
 HEMMER: Not a lot of compliments. To be continued. 
  
 MACCALLUM: So every candidate will have the opportunity to make a closing statement tonight. Each candidate will have 30 second for that. And we start with Governor Perry. 
  
 PERRY: Well, this is going to be a show me, don't tell me election. I think America is just a few good decisions and a leadership change at the top away from the best years we've ever had. And I think that the record of the governor of the last 14 years of the 12th largest economy in the world is just the medicine America is looking for. 
  
 1.5 million jobs created during the worst economic time this country has had since the Great Depression while the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs. We're talking about a state that moved graduation rates forward from 27th in the nation to second-highest. As a matter of fact, if you're Hispanic or African-American in Texas, you have the number one high school graduation rates in America. 
  
 Americans are looking for somebody that's going to give them, and there is a place in this country over the last eight years in particular that talked about hope every day, and they didn't just talk about it, they delivered it. And that was the state of Texas. And if we can do that in Texas, that 12th largest economy in the world, we can do it in America. 
  
 Our best days are in front of us. We can reform those entitlements, we can change that corporate tax code and lower it. We can put America back on track on a growth level and a growth rate that we've never seen in the history of this country. Manufacturing will flow back into this country. It just needs a corporate executive type at the top that's done it before. And I will suggest to you nobody's done it like Rick Perry has done it over the last eight years. And if you elect me president, we will bring incredible growth back to this country. And as someone who's worn the uniform of the country, that's how we build our military back up. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you Governor. Senator Santorum? 
  
 SANTORUM: I'll tell you how optimistic I am about America. Karen and I have seven children. You don't have seven children and bring them into this world if you're not optimistic about the future of this country. 
  
 I am, but people are upset, and they're upset for a reason about the future of this country. Donald Trump actually seized on it when he talked about immigration. And I think the reason he did is because immigration is sort of an example of what's broken and what's wrong in Washington, D..C. 
  
 You see, you have one side, the Democrats, and with immigration, all they care about is votes. They don't care about American workers, they just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can. ON the other side, you have so many Republicans, and what do they care about? Helping business make profits. There's nobody out there looking out for the American worker. 
  
 I'm looking out for the American worker. I'm the only one on this stage who has a plan that's actually reduced -- actually going to reduce immigration. Actually going to do something to help the American worker. And you combine that with a plan to make manufacturing -- this country number one in manufacturing, you've got someone who's going to help revitalize and give hope to America, the place -- the place is that is the most hopeless today. 
  
 That's why I ask for your support for president. 
  
 HEMMER: All right. Senator thank you. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Governor Jindal? 
  
 JINDAL: You know, we've got a lot of great talkers running for president. We've already got a great talker in the White House. We cannot afford four more years of on the job training. We need a doer, not a talker. We also need a nominee, a candidate who will endorse our own principles. 
  
 Jeb Bush says we've got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general. Let me translate that for you. That's the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us. That never works. If we do that again, we will lose again, we will deserve to lose again. 
  
 One principle, for example, we've got to embrace is on immigration. We must insist on assimilation -- immigration without assimilation is an invasion. We need to tell folks who want to come here, they need to come here legally. They need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves and get to work. 
  
 I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans and the division. I've got the backbone, I've got the band width, I've got the experience to get us through this. I'm asking folks not just to join my campaign, but join a cause. It is time to believe in America again. MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor. 
  
 HEMMER: Carly Fiorina, closing statement. 
  
 FIORINA: Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi, she lies about e- mails. She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party's frontrunner. 2016 is going to be a fight between conservatism, and a Democrat party that is undermining the very character of this nation. We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring. 
  
 I am not a member of the political class. I am a conservative; I can win this job, I can do this job, I need your help, I need your support. I will, with your help and support, lead the resurgence of this great nation. 
  
 Thank you. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Senator Graham. 
  
 GRAHAM: We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran, they've been killed a long time ago. That the Ayatollah is a radical jihadist who really means it when he chants, "Death to America, death to Israel." And this deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it, and money to pay for it all. 
  
 We need a president who can solve our problems, bring us together. We're becoming Greece if we don't work together. At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, our best days are ahead of us only if we work together, and I intend to put this country on a path of success by working together and doing the hard things that should have been done a very long time ago. 
  
 HEMMER: And to Governor Pataki, closing statement now. 
  
 PATAKI: With all the candidates, why me? 
  
 My background is different. I look at Washington, and I hear the talk, and I see the promises and it seems nothing ever changes. Washington gets bigger, taxes get higher, and the American people feel more distance from our government. I have the opportunity not just to run, but to win in the deep blue state of New York three times. And not only did I win, but I then worked with a Democratic legislature to put in place the most sweeping conservative reforms of any state in America, taking us from the most dangerous state in America to the fourth safest; reducing our welfare rolls by over 1 million, and replacing over 700,000 private sector jobs. 
  
 I can govern by bringing people together. And also, I've been tested in a way no one else has. I was governor on September 11th, and I'm proud of my leadership in bringing New York through that time. And when I left, we were stronger, we were safer, and we were more united than at any time in my lifetime. 
  
 We need to bring people together in Washington. The talk has got to stop, the action has got to begin. People can promise you something, I delivered in the blue state of New York. I will deliver for the American people if I have the privilege of leading this country. 
  
 HEMMER: Thank you, Governor. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Governor Gilmore. 
  
 GILMORE: Well, I was a conservative governor of Virginia, I governed that way, and that's my track record. But the key thing that we're seeing now is serious challenges to this country that must change, the direction of this nation must change. And that's why I've offered a specific program to the people of America tonight to address the fundamental problem of getting our country growing again, getting our economy growing, wages up, opportunities for people. 
  
 And second, the international crisis we are facing is most dreadful and most dangerous. I have the experience as a prosecutor, attorney general, governor, United States Army intelligence veteran, governor during the 9/11 attack, chairman of the Terrorism Commission for this country. It's time for real substance and real experience. 
  
 And that's what I'll offer to the people of the United States in this candidacy for the presidency. 
  
 MACCALLUM: Thank you, Governor.

 And the first debate question of the 2016 campaign goes to ... Rick Perry. 
  
 The former Texas governor was asked why voters should choose him as the party's nominee at Thursday's pre-debate forum. 
  
 Taking part are the seven lower-polling candidates who didn't make the cut for the prime-time debate. 
  
 The main event starts at 9 p.m. with 10 candidates, selected based on their rank in five recent national polls. 
  
 Perry said being the powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work, and said he's ready for the job four years after his first run for president. 
  
 There were only a few people in the seats at Quicken Loans Arena to watch the early debate, which includes Perry and three other current or former governors, a sitting senator from a crucial early-voting state, a former senator and the GOP's only female White House candidate.

 4:35 p.m. 
  
 The National Rifle Association will air its first political ad of the 2016 campaign during Thursday night's Republican presidential debate. 
  
 Their target: Gun control advocate and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
  
 The 30-second spot suggests that the billionaire media mogul is either running for president or wants to pick the next one. The ad says his agenda will be: "Outlaw your snack foods. Drive up your electric bill. Dismantle your gun rights." 
  
 Bloomberg has been a major financier of gun control advocates in recent years, including spending millions backing candidates who favor curbing gun rights. 
  
 The NRA has spent millions doing the opposite. 
  
 The NRA said it will spend around $1 million on the ad, which will run on Fox News, CNN and on local television in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. All three are home to early presidential primaries or caucuses. 
  
 The ad will also appear digitally in those states and South Carolina, another early primary state.

 3:25 p.m. 
  
 Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul says the indictment of a longtime political aide to his family is "a little bit of a distraction" as he heads into the first Republican debate of the 2016 presidential campaign. 
  
 Federal prosecutors this week unsealed charges against Jesse Benton and two others who worked for Rand Paul's father during then-Rep. Ron Paul's 2012 campaign for president. 
  
 They are accused of conspiring to buy the support of an Iowa state senator just before that year's Iowa caucuses. 
  
 Rand Paul tells WBKO-TV in Bowling Green, Kentucky, that it's "suspicious that President Obama's administration is bringing this forward in the middle of a presidential debate." 
  
 Benton has temporarily stepped down from his role at a super PAC supporting Rand Paul's White House bid. 
  
 He says in an email to The Associated Press that he "will return soon when I am exonerated."

 President Barack Obama expects a lot of the talk at the first presidential debate of the 2016 Republican primary campaign will be about him. 
  
 But he's not clearing his schedule to watch all of Thursday night's event in Cleveland. 
  
 White House spokesman Josh Earnest says Obama is interested in the arguments that will be made and will be following the news coverage of the debate. 
  
 Earnest predicts most of the debate will be about Obama and his use of his influence. But the White House isn't preparing responses they can send out right away to criticism leveled by the GOP candidates. 
  
 On the Republican side, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will be watching the two-hour debate. 
  
 McConnell says it "should be a lot of fun."

 South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has some advice for the Republican presidential candidates getting ready for their first debate: Be respectful and embrace solutions. 
  
 Haley tells a summer meeting of the Republican National Committee on Thursday that her state is still healing from the horror of June's racially motivated massacre at an African-American church. 
  
 Haley says that people coming together in the wake of the shooting led to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state capital in Columbia. 
  
 The second-term Republican governor says if that kind of consensus can happen in South Carolina, "just think of what we can do across this country." 
  
 She spoke at a GOP lunch just blocks from the site of Thursday night's debate in Cleveland. 
  
 She says she'll be watching for substance and details at the debate. Her message for the candidates: "Tell me how you're going to solve our problems."

 Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker are giving him a rousing send-off as the Wisconsin governor heads to Ohio for the first debate of the 2016 campaign. 
  
 Cheers of "Go get 'em, Scott!" rang out from a crowd Thursday at the Wisconsin State Fair, where Walker visited before leaving for Cleveland. 
  
 Walker, looking relaxed in a blue fair polo shirt, jeans and sneakers, said at the opening ceremony he couldn't miss the first day of an annual event he loves. 
  
 He also noted that Abraham Lincoln visited the Wisconsin State Fair in 1859, the year before he was elected president. 
  
 Walker says he'll be back at the fair next week to participate in a meat auction, livestock auction and to take his two nieces on the potato-sack slide.

 It's a big day for Republicans, but Democrats are making some debate news of their own. 
  
 The Democratic National Committee released plans for its presidential debates on Thursday, announcing the first of six will be held Oct. 13 in Nevada. 
  
 Four debates are planned for early primary states in advance of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. 
  
 That decision has already prompted complaints from candidates trying to challenge front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton for the nomination. 
  
 Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says "it would be very foolish for the DNC and bad for our party, bad for our prospects, for us to be the party that limits debates." 
  
 Dates for the final two gatherings are not yet set. But the committee says they will be in February or March. ||||| The Republican candidates repeated their opposition to the nuclear agreement reached with Iran by President Obama and other world leaders in part on the concern that Iran would profit from the lifting of sanctions. “We’re giving them $150 billion plus,” Donald J. Trump said. 
  
 The world powers are not giving Iran money, but by easing or terminating sanctions they would allow Iran to have access to many billions of dollars of its own money that have been frozen in overseas accounts. Much of the money came from Iranian sales of oil and other goods and has been frozen in China, India, South Korea and other countries for years. 
  
 Whether it would be as high as $150 billion is unknown. As Rick Gladstone reported in The Times, the Treasury Department has estimated that Iran has between $100 billion and $125 billion in foreign exchange assets worldwide, but that its usable liquid assets after sanctions relief would be much lower, more like $50 billion. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew told Congress that after Iran’s financial obligations, it would have roughly $56 billion left. 
  
 The governor of Iran’s central bank said last week that of roughly $77 billion held abroad, only $29 billion would be usable because the rest had already been committed to petrochemical investments or as collateral for Chinese-financed development projects. But critics said those estimates are too low and an attempt to shape the political debate. ||||| Less than halfway through the debate for Republican presidential hopefuls not quite popular enough for the main stage, the consensus was clear: Carly Fiorina nailed it. 
  
 She wasn’t flustered by questions that centered on how she is such a long-shot candidate, instead assuming the air of a composed and poised executive. She called Hillary Rodham Clinton a liar and criticized the GOP field’s new front-runner, Donald Trump. She managed to talk longer than nearly everyone else on the crowded stage. Oh, and she was funny. 
  
 Twitter buzzed with compliments, she spiked in Google searches and political commentators deemed her the winner. 
  
 “They should invite carly fiorina back for the 9 oclock debate,” former House speaker Newt Gingrich wrote on Twitter. 
  
 [For undercard GOP candidates, a low bar]

 The performance was classic Carly. The former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard — who has never held elected office — has often earned warm applause, laughter and standing ovations from conservative audiences in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
  
 But those standout performances have yet to give her any sort of meaningful bump in early polls. Many voters still don’t know who she is, frequently mispronouncing her last name. That’s why she was participating in Thursday’s second-tier debate rather than the prime-time event featuring the 10 highest-polling candidates. 
  
 Her closest competition for attention was former Texas governor Rick Perry, who stumbled four years ago by declaring “oops!” on a presidential debate stage but was generally well-received on Thursday. 
  
 [Live: Minute-by-minute updates of the GOP debate] 
  
 Fiorina’s performance yet again sparked the question: Is this the moment that will allow her to break out of the bottom tier of candidates, even by a little bit? 
  
 The first question of the night bluntly laid out the challenges facing Fiorina: “You were CEO of Hewlett-Packard. You ran for Senate and lost in California in 2010. This week, you said: ‘Margaret Thatcher was not content to manage a great nation in decline, and neither am I.’ Given your current standings in the polls, is the Iron Lady comparison a stretch?” 
  
 Fiorina didn’t flinch, comparing herself to four former U.S. presidents. “Well, I would begin by reminding people that at this point in previous presidential elections, Jimmy Carter couldn’t win, Ronald Reagan couldn’t win, Bill Clinton couldn’t win, and neither could have Barack Obama,” Fiorina said.

 Fiorina introduced herself to viewers with this quick bio: She worked her way up to becoming CEO of the largest technology company in the world, so she understands the economy, global markets and reducing bureaucracy. 
  
 “I understand leadership, which sometimes requires a tough call in a tough time,” said Fiorina, who was forced out of Hewlett-Packard following a nasty battle with her board that became painfully public at times. “But mostly, the highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status quo and unlock the potential of others.” 
  
 Fiorina delivered perhaps the most memorable lines of the debate when asked why Trump was doing so well in the polls. 
  
 [Does it matter than the first GOP debate is missing the race’s only woman?] 
  
 “Well, I don’t know, I didn’t get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race,” she quipped, referring to a conversation between Clinton and Trump before the latter joined the 2016 race. “Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn’t. Maybe it’s because I hadn’t given money to the foundation or donated to his wife’s Senate campaign.” 
  
 What she didn’t mention is that she had shared a stage with the former president during a Clinton Global Initiative event last year in Denver. Fiorina then turned serious and suggested that Trump had “tapped into an anger that people feel. They’re sick of politics as usual.” 
  
 Fiorina’s harshest criticism was, as always, for Hillary Clinton. Fiorina has argued that as a woman, she would be able to aggressively take on Clinton without fear of being labeled sexist. 
  
 “Hillary Clinton lies about Benghazi. She lies about e-mails,” Fiorina said. “She is still defending Planned Parenthood, and she is still her party’s front-runner.” 
  
 Fiorina also took a veiled shot at former Florida governor Jeb Bush, a candidate who has stumbled on the campaign trail. 
  
 “We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring,” Fiorina said. 
  
 Philip Rucker in Cleveland contributed to this report. ||||| Adding insult to injury, the Republican candidates who didn’t make the cut for the first GOP presidential prime-time debate were reminded over and over Thursday evening of their long-shot status, with the moderators throwing at them variations of the same wounding question: Why are you even here? 
  
 Only Carly Fiorina may have found the break-out moment she needed, with pundits and insta-polls crowning her as the clear winner of the undercard debate, as she delivered a smooth, commanding performance while others struggled to gain traction. 
  
 Story Continued Below 
  
 It was a tough environment for the candidates who didn’t poll high enough to participate in the 9 p.m. Fox News prime-time edition, a list that includes current and former governors, senators and a business executive, many of whose campaigns have already bristled at the debate participation metrics — and at being edged out of the bigger debate in part by the loud-mouthed Donald Trump. 
  
 And Fox News moderators Martha MacCallum and Bill Hemmer piled on by highlighting the candidates’ underdog positions, opening with a series of questions that underscored the candidates’ faltering poll numbers. A sampling: Fiorina was asked whether comparing herself to Margaret Thatcher was a stretch; Rick Santorum, who was the GOP runner-up in 2012, was asked whether his moment had passed, and Bobby Jindal was reminded of his flagging poll numbers back home in Louisiana, a line of overtly skeptical questioning that candidates endured with varying levels of good humor. 
  
 Former Govs. Rick Perry, George Pataki and Jim Gilmore; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, former Sen. Rick Santorum and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Fiorina, the only female candidate in the Republican field, did not qualify for the main stage and instead gathered at the 5 p.m. forum in Cleveland, an event that Graham in particular has referred to as the “happy hour debate.” 
  
 They appeared before a near-empty auditorium and were subjected to sometimes-patronizing remarks, such as when Hemmer, commending them on sticking to the time limits, said, “You’re all very well-behaved so far.” And though several campaigns had argued that since the forum didn’t include the bombastic Trump, they would have more time for substantive debate, the real estate mogul was the subject of the second round of questions, which went to Fiorina and Perry. 
  
 Perry, who has been a particularly harsh critic of the controversial real estate mogul, dismissed his celebrity status and then tried to pivot to highlight his own policy accomplishments, while Fiorina landed the first and only major jab of the night. 
  
 “I didn’t get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race, did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton?” she asked sarcastically, referencing a recent Washington Post report indicating that Trump and Clinton had spoken before he jumped into the race. “Maybe it’s because I didn’t give money to [the Clinton] Foundation or donate to his wife’s Senate campaign.” 
  
 (A spokeswoman for the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record emailed to note, “Carly Fiorina sure seemed to like Hillary Clinton back when she spoke before the Clinton Global Initiative.”) 
  
 She went on to argue that people are angry about being “failed” by the “political class,” a sentiment that, she said, Trump has tapped into. 
  
 “I would also say, since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, ‘What are the principles by which you will govern?’” she added. 
  
 For the long shots in the first debate, the goal was twofold: to offer a standout performance that will linger in the minds of activists and donors even as the 9 p.m. debate is expected to ultimately overshadow the earlier forum, and to come across as serious and credible, even if their viability is not reflected in the polls. 
  
 Fiorina, who is the GOP field’s most frequent and pointed critic of Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, was already in the spotlight heading into the forum. Earlier this summer, she was the field’s most vocal candidate about the importance of getting on the bigger debate stage. She fundraised off of the issue and mentioned it frequently in speeches, but still fell short. 
  
 But on Thursday, she delivered a relatively smooth and high-energy performance as she fielded a series of questions, from technology to foreign policy, fluently and with specifics, and also worked in a couple of Clinton criticisms. 
  
 “We have arrived at a point in our nation’s history where the potential of this nation and too many Americans [are] being crushed by the weight, the power, the cost, the complexity, the ineptitude, the corruption of the federal government,” she said, punctuating each phrase with an emphatic hand gesture, when asked whether she could “inspire” the country. “And only someone who will challenge the status quo of Washington, D.C. can lead the resurgence of this great nation. I will do that.” 
  
 The questions for the candidates were wide-ranging, touching on subjects from immigration to the war on terror to entitlement reform. Many of the candidates used the issues to wade into familiar talking point territory. 
  
 Santorum was eager to talk up his record of fighting abortion, something he did more passionately than any of the other candidates, and sought to distinguish himself as the only candidate focused on helping the “American worker.” 
  
 Graham, one of the Senate’s leading national security hawks, used just about every question to pivot to defense and foreign policy issues. But the senator, who frequently displays wit and self-deprecating humor on the stump, appeared wooden and downbeat Thursday evening. 
  
 Perry turned often to a favorite subject: his efforts to stop the border crisis afflicting his state last summer, and his pledges to secure the border more broadly. It was a base-friendly message that Perry delivered with energy at a high-stakes moment for his repeat candidacy: His 2012 presidential bid crumbled in part because of disastrous debate performances, something his team attributed to severe pain following back surgery. The former Texas governor has spent more than a year seeking to rehabilitate his image and studying up on policy, and he and his allies were adamant that he would qualify for the 9 p.m. debate, which would have provided a major national platform on which to demonstrate improvement from 2012. 
  
 But in a blow to his campaign, Perry was ultimately edged out by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who announced his presidential bid recently and may have enjoyed a bump in polling right ahead of the debate. 
  
 During the undercard debate, Perry didn’t have the standout performance that Fiorina delivered, but — aside from a brief, minor foreign policy misstep — he offered a solid delivery that relied heavily on touting his economic record in Texas, and offered several flashes of humor. 
  
 Moderators also sought to generate clashes between the candidates onstage and Kasich, who qualified, barely, for the 9 p.m. debate. Kasich accepted an Obamacare-related Medicaid expansion in his state, where the candidates were gathered for the debate, and Jindal was pressed over whether he disagreed with the governor’s decision. 
  
 “I don’t think anyone should expand Medicaid,” Jindal said. “I think it was a mistake to expand Medicaid everywhere across Ohio and across the country.” 
  
 Pataki was asked whether he agreed. He did, he said, but didn’t otherwise take the bait to go after Kasich. 
  
 Jindal didn’t deviate much from talking points, but he was articulate in his delivery and made a point to blast Jeb Bush directly, in contrast to the other candidates onstage. 
  
 “Jeb Bush says we’ve got to be willing to lose the primary in order to win the general,” he said as he called for a more conservative approach. “Let me translate that. That’s the establishment telling us to hide our conservative principles to get the left and the media to like us. That never works. If we do that again we will lose again. We will deserve to lose again.” ||||| Republicans are taking the stage in Cleveland for the first candidates’ debates of the 2016 election cycle. The main primetime debate is at 9 p.m. ET, featuring the top 10 candidates — as judged by poll averages. Ahead of that, at 5 p.m., is a debate for the seven candidates who didn’t make the cut. Here is our live blog. ||||| This collaborative project is an extension of the 2016 End of Term project, intended to document the federal government's web presence by archiving government websites and data. As part of this preservation effort, URLs supplied from partner institutions, as well as nominated by the public, will be crawled regularly to provide an on-going view of federal agencies' web and social media presence. Key partners on this effort are the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative and the Data Refuge project. This collection is a continuation of the 2016 End of Term web archiving and, as such, is deduplicated against that collection. It allows for the ongoing archiving of publicly nominated websites beyond the "official" end of the End of Term project. 
  
 Interested members of the public, particularly government information specialists, are invited to submit selected web sites to be included in the collection using the public nomination tool.
