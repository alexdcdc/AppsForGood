Some parents at Llangennech school object to the council's policy of extending Welsh medium provision.
A letter has been sent to the council by the solicitor of one of the parents.
The council plans to extend Welsh medium provision in schools, partly in response to census figures which show a fall in Welsh speakers in the county.
It has said replacing Llangennech Infant and Llangennech Junior schools with a new Welsh-medium community primary would ensure "bilingualism is increased" in the area.
A petition previously submitted to the council said the move would have a "massive impact" on children in the community who seek an English-medium education.
