Noel Moss, 68, was hurt when a tractor rolled over him at his farm. There was no nearby ambulance available.
An ambulance had to be sent from 34 miles away in Ballyshannon, County Donegal.
The incident happened on Tuesday 28 July but details have just emerged.
John McPoland of the Ambulance Service said: "We got a call about an incident involving a tractor and we are extremely sorry that it took so long.
"We apologise to Mr Moss and his family.
"A rapid response paramedic was there within 23 minutes providing treatment and pain relief to Mr Moss.
"We were trying to get an available ambulance. The paramedic who was on site did say to the team that an ambulance was urgent.
"It is an unacceptable time for us to get to a scene.
"This is a man who had internal injuries. We feel like we let Mr Moss down."
Mr McPoland explained that all the ambulances were involved in other emergency calls.
"We have serious challenges when it comes to rural communities. I wouldn't want to see this happen again," he said.
"Every part of the health service will tell you today that they could be doing with more resources."
Mr McPoland said the ambulance service would like to meet Mr Moss and his family to explain what happened.
