"One of the most promising young men of his generation," they said, in a statement released by police.

They added: "Gifted both academically and in his sporting abilities, he excelled in everything that he did.
"He was strong and athletic and so much enjoyed his sports, particularly rugby, where he was in his element playing within his team, and his friends."
