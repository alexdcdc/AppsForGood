Police let Madonna off with waving guns on stage at sell-out Murrayfield gig 
  
 MADONNA won’t face action by cops after defying a ban on waving guns on stage at her Murrayfield gig. 
  
 The Queen of Pop had been warned not to brandish the dummy weapons before Saturday’s show. 
  
 She was slammed by critics as she kept the routine in her set less than 48 hours after the Colorado cinema killings. 
  
 Madge, 50, even joked with the crowd that the concert may be “cut off” because of Scotland’s gun laws – brought in after the Dunblane massacre in 1996. 
  
 But yesterday the Lothian and Borders force insisted there would be no action taken over the firearms display at the gig. 
  
 The show – her first in Scotland – didn’t go down well with many punters. 
  
 Lindsay Galbraith, from Glasgow, tweeted: “Madonna gig pretty disappointing and sound at Murrayfield truly awful.” 
  
 And Aileen Muir wrote: “Perhaps the worst concert I’ve been to.”
