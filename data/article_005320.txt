Denbighshire council is in talks with an unnamed party over the sale of the castle, which is currently run by a trust as a museum and art gallery.
In March the council said would be cutting the trust's annual grant of Â£144,000 from next year.
The council has been asked to comment.
This led to the trust having to sever its links with the National Portrait Gallery, with its collection of 130 paintings returned in April and seven trust staff being made redundant.
Set in 260 acres, the first castle on the site was built in about 1460 before it was rebuilt in the 1830s.
The freehold sale includes the castle, lawns and event arena.
The council will retain the woodland and parkland which includes the recently reconstructed World War One trenches.
Running alongside the castle's museum and gallery is the Bodelwyddan Castle Hotel which recently underwent a Â£6m upgrade.
It is run by the Warner Group, which is understood to be interested in taking over the whole complex.
A spokesman for Warner Leisure Hotels said: "We have spoken to the Denbighshire County Council about the future plans for the castle and those discussions continue".
