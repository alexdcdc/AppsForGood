Separate road access for buses and cars, and a "well-managed" pick up and drop off area are among the changes.
Revellers experienced long delays leaving the site at the 2015 event, its first at Strathallan, Perthshire.
DF Concerts have also promised a new bus depot with over 40 stances.
They have produced an animated video showing the new transport set-up.
T in the Park traffic manager Ian Martin, said: "The changes to the on-site transport set up are significant. We've not tweaked last year's.
"We started with a blank piece of paper and after months of testing and liaising with our partner agencies, including Transport Scotland, Perth & Kinross Council and Police Scotland as well as local community councils, we have a solid plan in place."
Following last year's festival, DF Concerts said "challenging ground conditions" had been compounded by "people not following directions", causing tailbacks on local roads.
Heavy rain meant the ground became muddy and some cars had to be towed from car parks to get them out safely, causing queues.
Mr Martin said: "The separated routes for buses and cars will help keep traffic moving and the bus station will make travelling with Citylink and Big Green Coach the best ways to get to and from the festival.
"With an event of this scale, an element of patience will always be required when getting in and out of the site, but I can guarantee this will be of a normal level and managed by an experienced team."
Police Scotland's head of road policing, Insp David Hynd, said the organisers had "taken on board" last year's issues.
He said: "I would ask all those travelling to and from the event to plan ahead and follow the instructions and advice provided on the various social media and websites."
Earlier this month, the promoter announced that this year's festival arena will increase in size by a third and the campsite by a quarter.
