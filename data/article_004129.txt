John Burns targeted the 42-year-old teacher on waste ground in the Drumchapel area of Glasgow in May.
He pinned the victim to the ground and told her he had a knife, but fled after she struggled and told him she needed to visit her father in hospital.
Police later traced Burns and his DNA was found on the woman's clothes. He will be sentenced at a later date.
The High Court in Paisley heard how the attack was caught on CCTV.
The teacher had been walking alone when she was grabbed from behind and bundled to the ground.
Prosecutor Paul Brown said Burns then lay on top of the victim, leaving her unable to get away.
Mr Brown added: "She shouted repeatedly: 'No, please don't'.
"At this point, Burns said into her ear: 'Keep quiet - keep still, I've got a knife."
Burns then began molesting the woman who kept telling him to stop.
The attacker told her at one point: "Just let me do it then."
Mr Brown said: "She was terrified. She continued to struggle and shout."
As the woman continued to plead, she then told Burns: "I need to go to the hospital to see my dad."
The court heard Burns seemed to "stop in his tracks" and suddenly got up from the victim.
He then fled before the woman managed to make it to a local police station.
Officers later visited Burns' home in Drumchapel and found that the glasses he wore matched the description of those worn by the attacker.
His DNA was also found to be on the victim's clothing.
