Australian utility back Marc Koteczky, 25, has agreed a new contract, having played 16 times for the club in the Championship last season.
He is joined by compatriot and former Australia Under-20s cap Ethan Ford.
Ford, who is English-qualified through his grandmother, can play at centre, wing or full-back and played alongside Koteczky at Sydney-based club Randwick.
"I'm looking forward to joining up with the Plymouth Albion squad and experiencing rugby in England," Ford said.
"I've heard a lot of good things about the club and the city. I know Marc well from Randwick, so it will be great to play alongside him again.
"I'm excited about the challenge that awaits."
Plymouth Albion were relegated from the Championship in April after 13 years in English rugby's second tier.
