"I'm delighted with the spirit and character of the players. They deserved that point today and they deserved that clean sheet. I'm delighted for everybody.
"We've conceded too many goals of late, haven't we? That's no secret. We needed to shore things up. We've been trying to do that and still be an attacking threat. Today, I think we were.
"I don't know if I'll be in charge next game. I'll just report in tomorrow and get on with it until somebody tells me different. When the club's ready to appoint the manager, he'll come in.
"I haven't applied for the job and if the club want to talk to me about it, they know where I am."
