Margaride Rufino, 38, and Anthony Roberts, 37, were found dead at an address in Cross Road, Idle, on Sunday evening.
Their two-year-old daughter, who was not present at the property, is being cared for by family members, police said.
Detectives are treating the incident as murder but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
Officers were called to the property after receiving reports of a domestic incident.
Ms Rufino, known as Guida, was found with serious neck injuries while Mr Roberts was discovered with leg injuries.
They were both pronounced dead at the scene.
Two knives were recovered from the property and West Yorkshire Police has appealed for witnesses come forward.
