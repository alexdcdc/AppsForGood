The idea was proposed by the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny.
However it appeared to have been dropped this week after the DUP gave it a cool response.
Ms Villiers said co-operation between the Irish and British Governments alongside the Executive was vital.
She added the current North South Bodies were working well, advising "I haven't seen a case for a fresh body to be added to the current structures".
She has also denied the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement that he was going to cut Corporation Tax across the UK to below 15 per cent was a blow to Northern Ireland,
She described it as a "big plus" and a "tremendous opportunity".
"It makes 12.5% for Northern Ireland more affordable for the Executive to deliver," she added.
