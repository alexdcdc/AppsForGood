The former Reds forward is unattached after quitting professional football with Peterborough in November.
Gormley has also been linked with a move to rivals Crusaders recently.
However, Lyttle remains optimistic about a potential return for the man who struck 122 goals for the North Belfast club during a four-year spell at Solitude.
"Of course," Lyttle told BBC Sport NI when asked if Gormley's return was a possibility.
"It's well-documented that Joe is a big Cliftonville man, he's a die-hard fan and he did an unbelievable job when he was here before.
"He's a player I'm close to and a player I've worked with before.
"I'm due to talk to him in the next few days so hopefully we can sort something with Joe then."
As is stands, Gormley would be unable to play for Cliftonville this season having already represented Peterborough and St Johnstone.
Peterborough director of football Barry Fry in November said Peterborough, St Johnstone and Gormley had all written letters to Fifa for asking for special dispensation to cancel his contract by mutual consent outside the January window.
The striker's goal lifted Cliftonville to successive Premiership titles in 2013 and 2014. He was also named the Northern Ireland Football Writers' Association Player of the Year for the 2013/14 season before moving to Peterborough in the summer of 2015.
Gormley suffered a serious knee injury after joining Peterborough and Fry said that player had become  "disillusioned with football" and was seeking a return to part-time football.
The Northern Irishman did not score during his spell at Peterborough and further short loan stint at St Johnstone.
