Lewis Kerr, 25, from Snettisham in Norfolk, collided with another rider at the event on Sunday before crashing into a fence.
He was flown to hospital by helicopter and the meeting was abandoned.
Team manager George English said the rider's family was at his bedside at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mr English added: "It was not a good looking crash and it instantly became apparent that Lewis needed major attention.
"The paramedic team were superb and gave Lewis the very best of attention on the track, but also realised that it was important to get him to hospital as soon as possible."
A spokesman for the British Speedway Promotion Agency (BSPA) said: "Lewis is in a stable condition and is in the very best place for care and attention.
"There was no alternative but to abandon the meeting. All of the riders were in no state to continue after seeing what had happened.
"Our thoughts are with Lewis and his family, and we wish him a full, successful and speedy recovery.
"Our information at this stage is that he is in an induced coma and as and when any further updates are available we will issue further bulletins.
"Everyone within British Speedway sends our best wishes to Lewis and his family, and we hope for good news soon."
Mr Kerr joined the Newcastle Diamonds on loan from King's Lynn at the start of 2013.
