It said the dispute centred on the future of the company's drivers after plans were put forward to transfer 87 members to haulier Eddie Stobart.
Unite, which represents more than 700 Co-op drivers, said it had been given "a firm commitment for their future" in line with a five-year plan.
The Co-op said it was pleased with the ballot's outcome.
Unite said it recommended its members accept an offer following two days of talks at conciliation service Acas.
Members were based in Derbyshire, County Durham, Coventry, Essex, Devon, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
A "large number" voted in favour of the proposals, the union said.
Adrian Jones, from Unite, said: "We are confident that our members have a secure future with the Co-op and that our concerns about the future of in-house transport have been fully addressed."
Of the 87 affected drivers in Coventry, 67 took a severance package and 20 went to Eddie Stobart, the union said.
A Co-op spokesman said: "We have always maintained our commitment to retaining our in-house operations, and are glad that colleagues have recognised this."
