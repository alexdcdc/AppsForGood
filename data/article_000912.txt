Officers said they were becoming increasingly concerned for the welfare of Farrah Fadli, 29, McKenzie Scullion, 10, and Eva Kerr, 4.
Ms Fadli, who is also known as Farrah Gillespie and lives in Ayr, was last seen by one of her friends at about 11:00 on Wednesday.
Police said her disappearance was out of character.
Insp Jim Hendrie, said: "Farrah has never gone missing before and it is believed at this time that she may have gone missing with her two children, which is very concerning.
"Whilst at this time we don't have any information that they may have come to harm, Farrah hasn't been in touch with anyone since Wednesday, which is out of character.
"We're continuing inquiries to trace Farrah and her children, because as time passes, we are becoming very concerned for their welfare.
"I would ask anyone who knows where Farrah is to contact police. It is imperative that we find her and her two children safe and well."
Ms Faldi is 5ft 4in, of slim build with dyed blonde hair. Her son, McKenzie, is about 4ft 10in, of average build, with brown hair and blue eyes.
Police said Eva was of average height and build for her age, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
