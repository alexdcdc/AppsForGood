Spurs, who reached the final with a 3-2 aggregate win over Sheffield United, beat the Blues in a Premier League clash 5-3 on New Year's Day.
"We are not afraid," said Eriksen. "We will go there with no fear and it will be a good show."
The Danish midfielder scored twice as Spurs drew 2-2 with the Blades to seal their place in the final on 1 March.
His second came in the 88th minute after the Blades had gone 2-1 thanks to goals from 18-year-old substitute Che Adams.
Eriksen's first was a free-kick in the 28th minute.
The 22-year-old has now scored decisive goals in the 87th minute or later four times in the last 16 games.
"It means a lot to get to Wembley, we are all really excited," he said.
"The first goal, a free-kick, was one of the better ones I have scored. It was a bit surprising to hit that so high in the net. I don't practice free-kicks that often."
He also praised Tottenham's League One opponents.
"Sheffield United were impressive," he said. "They played like a Premier League team. They should play higher."
Chelsea reached the final with a 2-1 aggregate win over Liverpool.
