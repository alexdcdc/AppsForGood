The city received the funding for its Nextbike scheme from Sustrans Scotland, which encourages cycling travel.
The 11 new stations were officially launched by Minister for Transport and the Islands, Humza Yousaf at Stirling's Albert Halls.
The scheme's expansion has increased the number of bikes available to rent in Stirling from 100 to 160.
The investment was secured by local charity Forth Environment Link.
The charity's director, Clara Walker said: "Since its initial launch the scheme has been hugely popular.
"We've recorded over 13,000 journeys and usage is growing by 40% year on year."
Bridge of Allan railway station and Castleview park & ride are among the new locations included in the scheme, which has been running in Stirling since 2014.
Stirling Provost Mike Robbins said: "Cycling is one of the best ways to see and get round our beautiful city.
"Doubling the number of Nextbike stations in and around the city at key locations such Teith House and The Peak will make it easier for our staff to use bikes to get to and from meetings.
"New bike stations at the park and ride sites will also open up the opportunity for staff to park their cars there and cycle into the city for work."
