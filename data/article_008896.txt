The 33-year-old led the club to two successive promotion finals, winning promotion at the second attempt with a 2-1 victory over Chelmsford in May.
"It's a great gesture from the owner," he told BBC Radio Kent.
"It shows great commitment to me, and I'm looking forward to rewarding that commitment he's shown me by taking the club forward."
