Simon Reynolds, of Farnham in Surrey, did not return to Sheffield Crown Court on Thursday and a manhunt was launched.
Reynolds, who was found guilty of four counts of theft, handed himself in at a police station in Sheffield on Monday.
He was vicar at All Saints Church in Darton when the thefts took place and has been sentenced to 32 months.
