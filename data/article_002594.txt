The party had a total income of £159,516 in 2014 - three times what it raised the previous year - but spent nearly all of that on campaigning.
A total of 286 parties reported having gross income and total expenditure of £250,000 or less in 2014.
Three parties reported income and spending between £100,000 and £250,000.
Britain First, an offshoot of the BNP, which contested last year's European elections in Wales and Scotland, spent its income on "protests, small scale direct action, rallies and meetings", according to its accounts.
The Communist Party of Britain's accounts show its income, from membership fees and donations, has remained steady, and its membership stood at 917 in 2014.
It raised £138,162, which was spent on organising anti-austerity marches, trade union work and supporting its daily newspaper The Morning Star.
The party was founded in 1920 as the Communist Party of Great Britain, and for many years received funds from the Soviet Union. It re-launched in 1988 as the Communist Party of Britain.
The Socialist Alliance, a tiny group of campaigners affiliated with the larger Alliance for Green Socialism, saw its income boosted from £91 in 2013 to £101,254, thanks to a bequest from a former member.
Most of the £101,166 from the legacy was spent on supporting candidates standing for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition at the general election, according to its accounts.
