 GARDNERVILLE, Nev. — While a handful of Republican students from the University of Nevada, Reno discussed politics over sausages and fried lamb testicles here last weekend, a woman decked out in a patriotic red, white and blue outfit walked by. She pointed to one of the students wearing a Dean Heller campaign sticker. 
  
 “It must be lonely,” she observed. 
  
 For Heller, the Nevada Republican who is widely considered the most endangered senator up for re-election in next year's midterm cycle, it was a sentiment that sums up his narrow and treacherous political path to victory. Facing substantial opposition from both conservatives within his own party and a general electorate trending Democratic, Heller's list of political foes sometimes appears far larger than his number of supporters.

 Heller's re-election challenge is three-fold: He must attract enough support from an increasingly conservative Nevada GOP base, especially in the northern part of the state, to avoid being ousted in a primary. He must manage a difficult relationship with President Donald Trump in order to avoid alienating voters in either the GOP primary or next fall's general election. And he has to be mindful of the state's overall electorate, which voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential race.

 Those challenges were evident at the third annual Basque Fry in August, a Republican fundraiser at a sprawling cattle ranch hosted by the political action committee of Adam Laxalt, the current Nevada attorney general and likely gubernatorial candidate. More than 2,000 Republicans mingled over Basque delicacies in between political speeches. 
  
 Many of the attendees were from the northern part of the state, where Republicans are often more conservative than their counterparts in more populous cities like Las Vegas. While Trump’s approval ratings hover around 38 percent nationally, Republicans here still support the president and they expect their elected officials to do the same. 
  
 That was top of mind for 75-year-old Claire Price of Incline Village, who said she is still angry that Heller didn't back Trump at last year’s event during the presidential campaign. “I thought that was a real political problem for him,” she said. 
  
 The Trump Factor 
  
 Republicans at the fundraiser were mostly supportive of the president and blamed Congress — as well as Heller, specifically — for any lack of progress on his agenda. 
  
 “I actually think it’s a pretty sad state of affairs that Congress will not support [the president] and make meaningful accomplishments, and our senators better be very careful in every state across the nation that if they don’t get behind their president and make things happen, they are going to lose their seats and I’m going to be a party to that,” said Leslie Burnside, 57, from Minden, Nev., who was wearing a camouflage Make America Great Again hat. 
  
 “I think [Trump has] succeeded as far as he can but I think the elected Republicans are letting him down at every level,” said Ron Dayton, a 66-year-old Marine veteran and retired truck driver from Dayton, Nev. “I blame Dean Heller.”

 Trump’s attacks on the GOP-led Congress appear to be working when it comes to these Republicans. But, as the Heller race illustrates, the consequence could be Republicans losing their narrow Senate majority if GOP primary voters succeed in defeating sitting incumbents or rejecting candidates with broader general election appeal. 
  
 And Trump is already playing a central role in both races. In the primary, Heller is facing Danny Tarkanian, a perennial candidate with a famous last name who is touting his total support for the president. 
  
 In the general, Heller would likely face Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who is seeking to show that his voting record is right in line with the Trump agenda. “Dean is going to stand on his own record. Nevadans know him for that and Nevadans don’t like him for that,” Rosen said in an interview after a gathering of progressive leaders in East Las Vegas. 
  
 So far, Heller has walked a fine line in his association with Trump even as the president's sometimes divisive style has clashed with Heller's jovial and mild-mannered public persona. 
  
 Despite their differences, which have included a public spat over health care reform, Heller insisted that he wasn't that far apart from the president in an interview with NBC News in Las Vegas last week. 
  
 “I work very closely with the White House and with President Trump,” Heller told NBC News. “I talked to him last week on the phone. We were talking about taking care of our veterans here in this country. So we’re in a very good place right now working together.” 
  
 Since January, Heller has kept a low profile both in Washington and in his home state, doing just a smattering of media interviews and keeping his public schedule confined to small and non-publicized events. 
  
 That approach was on display at the Gardnerville event. He showed up for just the last 20 minutes of the four-hour Basque Fry. He hovered mostly around the VIP tent where other elected officials and program participants sought shelter from the blistering sun and spoke to attendees who approached him instead of meandering through the crowd. 
  
 The Delicate Policy Dance 
  
 Aside from his relationship with the president, Heller has also come under fire from Nevada conservatives for a lack of ideological clarity. 
  
 He received heavy criticism last spring when he told a town hall audience in Reno that he has “no problem” funding Planned Parenthood, a hot-button issue for social conservatives. And while his spokesperson attempted to clarify the remarks, saying the senator remains opposed to federal funding of organizations that provide abortion services, many Republicans in the state are still holding it against him. 
  
 “He is a spineless, lying jellyfish,” said Burnside of Heller. 
  
 On health care, Heller held a news conference with popular Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval after the release of the Senate’s first version of the bill, saying that he wouldn’t support it because it would strip health care away from too many of the 600,000 Medicaid recipients in the state. 
  
 After arm-twisting by Trump that included a brief run of televised attack ads against him by a pro-Trump super PAC, Heller split the difference. He voted against the Senate’s more robust repeal and replace bill, and against a straight repeal of Obamacare — the same bill he supported in 2015 when there was no chance it would become law. But he voted for the most scaled-down version known as the “skinny” repeal, which failed by one vote. 
  
 “He brought his reps through our area and his people promised that he was going to support a repeal on Obamacare [on] July 8,” said Jeanette Nutcher, the caucus chair of Esmeralda County, a county halfway between Reno and Las Vegas that stretches 3,500 square miles but has a population of less than 800 people. “His representative lied to us.” 
  
 The health care vote was at the beginning of August. 
  
 John Manelly, a constituent from Mindon, is fed up with Heller, saying the senator went to Washington and became a weak conservative. 
  
 “He’s been too wishy-washy all along. His credibility is shot,” Manelly said. 
  
 Immigration is another key issue for these voters, many of whom said they support Trump’s pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the construction of a border wall and ending reprieve for the children of undocumented immigrants under President Obama's DACA program. 
  
 In his interview with NBC News last week, Heller shunned some of Trump's anti-immigrant policies, including a pardon of Arpaio. He also touted his support of comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, a bill that was reviled by many on the right. 
  
 “He is an open borders guy and instant legalization guy,” Dayton, the Marine veteran, said of the senator.

 But the immigration issue cuts the other way during a general election in a state where Latinos are a growing voter bloc. Latinos made up around 17 percent of the state’s electorate in the 2016 election. 
  
 And Heller's attempt to appeal to the Latino community, and shun some of the harsher edges of Trump's policies, hasn’t won over Rudy Zamora, an immigrant who benefited from DACA and got his U.S. citizenship last October. 
  
 "Dean Heller can say a lot of things,” Zamora said. “The day that Senator Dean Heller votes to protect DACA and protect our families will be the day we trust him.” 
  
 Heller's new campaign chair, Nevada Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, who called Heller "one of the finest people you’ll ever meet on planet Earth," said the senator will maintain his independence to do what's best for the Silver State. 
  
 "Dean will support President Trump when Trump pursues policies that benefit Nevada, and when he pursues policies that don’t benefit Nevada, then Dean’s gong to speak up and change the direction of that policy," Hutchison said. 
  
 The Primary Challenge 
  
 On paper, Heller would appear to be a heavy favorite in next June's Republican primary. Tarkanian, the son of legendary UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, has run five previous times in the state and never won in a general election. Heller, meanwhile, has never lost a political race and has the state and national GOP establishment backing him with both organization and, most importantly, resources. 
  
 But at the Gardnerville event, the conservative crowd gave Tarkanian a warm reception as he defended yet another run for political office by pointing to his last race where he lost by just 1 point — less than the margin Trump lost to Hillary Clinton in the state. 
  
 And voters here were enthused by Tarkanian's conservative candidacy and lock-step support for Trump on the issues — supporting the pardon of Arpaio, defending Trump’s response to the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, and getting behind his border wall. "I like what he's trying to accomplish policy-wise," Tarkanian said of the president. 
  
 Heller told NBC News that he’s “not worried” about his re-election. “I’ll let Danny do what Danny wants to do,” Heller said. “I wake up every morning trying to figure out what’s best for Nevada. Danny wakes up every morning trying to figure out what’s best for Danny.” 
  
 But Heller is preparing to return to work in Washington where he will face ten more months of difficult Senate votes on issues like raising the debt ceiling, funding the government, tax reform and possibly even health care again before the primary. 
  
 And with no big legislative successes in the first half of 2017 for senators like Heller to point to, the pressure is building from the base to deliver results. 
  
 “Personally, I like Dean Heller. But again he better get behind his president and get some stuff done,” 62 year-old Pam Bergamini of Garnerville said. 
  
 Pointing to Tarkanian who was standing across the dirt walk way, she continued, “And I have no problem voting for that guy if he doesn’t do his job.” ||||| Dean Heller knows he’s the most vulnerable Republican senator in the country. But he thinks Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy might just help him hang on to his seat. 
  
 “Kennedy is going to retire around sometime early summer,” Heller predicted in Las Vegas last week, according to audio of an event he spoke at that was obtained by POLITICO. “Which I’m hoping will get our base a little motivated because right now they’re not very motivated. But I think a new Supreme Court justice will get them motivated.”

 The 45-minute recording of the media-shy Heller shows a senator defending President Donald Trump repeatedly, breaking only delicately with the president on issues like trade and gun control. It’s in line with the tightrope Heller has to walk to have any hope of winning reelection against a Trump-inspired Republican primary opponent and a highly touted Democratic general election challenger — in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. 
  
 Heller can't afford to lose conservatives by breaking with Trump, yet must keep a lane to the center open to win a general election. It’s the trickiest political equation facing any GOP senator on the ballot this year.

 “I’m not going to sit here and criticize him,” Heller said when asked about Trump’s flirtation with Democrats on gun control. “Because everything else he’s touched, like this economy, has been just incredible. So, I don’t want to get too far in front of some of these policies.” 
  
 Many Republicans credit the Supreme Court vacancy in 2016 with keeping the Senate in GOP control — and making Trump president. Heller went on to float Sen. Mike Lee for the job, calling the Utah Republican the type of conservative who could energize Nevada's electorate in the June 12 primary. Lee's office declined to comment. 
  
 “Mike Lee from Utah is probably on that short list of the next Supreme Court justice in our courts,” Heller said during the Q-and-A session with the J. Reuben Clark Law Society in Las Vegas Friday. 
  
 But Trump was clearly most on Heller's mind. He dinged the president’s “crazy” tweets about North Korea, before quickly crediting him with fostering better relations with its neighbor to the south. “North Korea joined South Korea and goes to the Olympics. And they say, the only reason they did that was because of President Trump,” Heller said. 
  
 The Nevadan once declared that he was “100 percent against Clinton, 99 percent against Trump” and opposed early drafts of the GOP’s plan to repeal Obamacare, much to Trump’s annoyance. But now it’s hard to get Heller to say a cross word about the president, whom Heller seems to view as an asset rather than an anchor. 
  
 Trump’s comment last week that he would “take the guns first, go through due process second” turned Heller into the president’s explainer-in-chief. 
  
 “I think he misspoke, I can’t imagine that this president believes that. I think today, he does not,” Heller said. “Negotiator as he is, he says, 'I’m going to take a big bite, just so that I can negotiate it back.' I think he’s doing the same thing on trade. I don’t agree with tariffs, but I’m not going to criticize at this point until I see an end result.” 
  
 The senator declined to comment on his remarks. 
  
 Heller’s efforts to yoke himself to Trump could backfire in Nevada, a state where Democrats are betting on a key Senate pickup by knocking off Heller in November. In an interview, Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.) said that Trump is as much a drag on Republicans now as he was in 2016 when she defeated former Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.). 
  
 “I don’t think it’s changed … he not only could be, I think he is a drag,” Cortez-Masto said. And Heller “is going to have make that calculation for himself. But I know from what I’ve seen, he’s embraced President Trump.” 
  
 There may be no other way. Heck famously unendorsed Trump, then promptly lost to Cortez-Masto. Heller is leaning into the triangulation that made him the only incumbent GOP senator in a tough race to win reelection in 2012. 
  
 So when Heller was asked at the event about the special counsel investigation dogging Trump, he asserts that the probe should not be killed — before adding that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should appoint a second special counsel to investigate Democrats' efforts to compile damaging information on Trump. 
  
 “What I want is [the] Mueller investigation to continue. I don’t want this thing coming to an end,” Heller said. “I would have had the attorney general obviously do an investigation on the other side. They should be doing one simultaneously on both sides. … I’ve talked to the attorney general directly about it, but he’s chosen not to do so.” 
  
 He went on to fret about potential Russian interference in the 2018 elections, which includes his own race against Danny Tarkanian in the primary and, if Heller wins, Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) in the general election. 
  
 “This is the most difficult race in America. This is the No. 1 race in America,” Heller said, adding later: “ They did manipulate our elections. My biggest concern is — I’m going into ’18 and my biggest fear is [the Russians are] going to try to do it again.” 
  
 Republicans say Heller is doing the best he can, given the tough hand he’s been dealt running for reelection in the only competitive 2018 battleground that supported Clinton. 
  
 “After we passed tax reform we’ve seen him do well in terms of the data that I’m seeing,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), the vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. And, he added: “The president is very supportive of his [reelection].” 
  
 Heller aligned himself with Trump's criticism of the Senate’s glacial pace and arcane rules, which have slowed the pace of confirmations and contributed to the failure to repeal Obamacare. Though some credit Heller’s early criticisms of the GOP’s plans to repeal Obamacare with significantly dampening the prospects of health care reform, Heller, in the recording, name-checked Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins for voting down the so-called skinny repeal. 
  
 Articulating a major complaint of the GOP base, Heller said he wants to change Senate rules to allow much speedier confirmation of judges, something Republicans are discussing privately but which needs bipartisan support. Heller also complained about the 60-vote threshold stymieing his party’s progress on the budget, placing himself at odds with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is often attacked by insurgent GOP candidates. 
  
 “Our biggest difficulty is that Mitch McConnell likes the rules the way they are,” Heller said. “This 60-vote threshold that we have in the United States Senate, I’m tired of it.” 
  
 The 60-vote threshold blocked several immigration proposals last month. Heller voted for the president’s plan, which failed to crack 40 votes. Heller supported comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, but said in Las Vegas last week that the two parties no longer see eye to eye. 
  
 The senator sounds resigned to inaction on immigration reform in his remarks, a difficult admission in a state that is more than a quarter Hispanic. 
  
 “Republicans want illegal immigrants to work but not vote. Democrats want them not to work, but to vote. Think about that for a minute,” Heller said. “That’s why we can’t come together on a solution for this.” 
  
  ||||| Republicans are going to retain control of the Senate in 2018. I know that runs counter to the “blue wave” messaging that predicts white women will suddenly decide to not be partners in white supremacy, but the reality of the Senate map speaks for itself. Democrats are defending more seats, in many places where it’s hard for Democrats to win. Republicans are going to pick up seats. If you want to talk to me about resisting, you better be talking about secession as opposed to white women in Texas finding a moral center. 
  
 But that doesn’t mean every Republican will win. Dean Heller, Republican Senator from Nevada, faces a very tough re-election battle. You can tell he’s already desperate because of this report in Politico: 
  
 Dean Heller knows he’s the most vulnerable Republican senator in the country. But he thinks Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy might just help him hang on to his seat. “Kennedy is going to retire around sometime early summer,�? Heller predicted in Las Vegas last week, according to audio of an event he spoke at that was obtained by POLITICO. “Which I’m hoping will get our base a little motivated because right now they’re not very motivated. But I think a new Supreme Court justice will get them motivated.�? 
  
 Yes, Justice Anthony Kennedy retiring would indeed help struggling Republican candidates. We know that the Republican base will turn out to vote based on the Supreme Court more than the Democratic base will turn out to do the same. 
  
 But Heller has no evidence to support his wish that Kennedy will quit and save his political prospects. 
  
 We do have some evidence that Kennedy will be sticking around for at least another year. As we reported back in December, Kennedy has already hired clerks for the 2018-2019 term. 
  
 Hiring a full slate of clerks doesn’t guarantee that Kennedy is staying. But it’s more evidence that he’s staying than anything Dean Heller has in the opposite direction. Heller’s political need for Kennedy’s imminent retirement is the news here, not any new information about Anthony Kennedy’s plans. 
  
 Which isn’t to say that people should get used to having Anthony Kennedy around. Kennedy is old and has made it pretty clear that he doesn’t want to die at work. He could change his mind. He could have hired clerks just to throw people off the scent. He could also, you know, die. Any of them could die. Sotomayor is a diabetic. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is probably nothing more than a Force hologram at this point. If Republicans retain control of the Senate — which they WILL — it’s incredibly likely that Trump will get to pick another Supreme Court justice. 
  
 But Dean Heller doesn’t have any inside information. He’s just a guy trying to figure out how to hang onto his job. In the words of Nice Guy Eddie: “If you f***** beat this prick long enough, he’ll tell you he started the goddamn Chicago fire, now that don’t necessarily make it f****** so!”

 Heller is facing a tough GOP primary challenge ahead of the 2018 midterm elections from Las Vegas businessman Danny Tarkanian. 
  
 Kennedy’s possible retirement has been rumored for months. 
  
 Last June, multiple reports said Kennedy was considering announcing his retirement. 
  
 But the 80-year-old justice seemingly quashed those rumors in January when he hired four law clerks for the October term. 
  
 Kennedy, who was appointed to the court by President Reagan in 1988, is considered the most pivotal justice on the Supreme Court and is often known for casting the tie-breaking vote in contentious decisions. 
  
 While he's among the court's conservative justices, he has sided with his liberal colleagues at times, including on the court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.
