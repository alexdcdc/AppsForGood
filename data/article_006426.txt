The pole, thought to be at least six decades old, was recently found at St John's Church in Higham.
It will be used in a traditional may fair folk dance in the village later.
Maypole dancing was once an annual event around England but the tradition has faded in many places.
The pole's discovery prompted teachers at St John's Church of England Primary School to teach pupils maypole dances.
Deputy head teacher Dominic O'Neill said he hoped it would be "something we could continue".
"I think it's really, really important because it goes back to the essence of village, school, community and church," he said.

Brian Sutcliffe, who found the pole and has helped organise the dances, said it had "decades of dust on it" when he happened across it.
"Finding it after all these years of being abandoned, I was quite enthusiastic in renovating it and it's now going to relive its purpose," he said.
The restoration has included the pole being repainted and having new bright coloured ribbons attached.
The dances will mark the last day of the Higham Exhibition, a seasonal arts and craft fair and farmers market which has been running for the last 46 years.
