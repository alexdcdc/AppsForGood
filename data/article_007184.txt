The 25-year-old joins the Premiership club from Bradford Bulls, for whom he has scored 17 tries in 55 Super League appearances over three seasons.
Capped 15 times, Kear played in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup and has represented clubs in the UK and France.
"I always followed rugby union up until I was 18 in Cardiff and it's always been a view of mine to come back and really give it a go," he said.
Kear appeared for the Exiles in the club's pre-season friendly at Henley Hawks, scoring one of Welsh's 10 tries in a 64-0 victory.
A product of the Cardiff Demons academy system, he made his Super League debut for Crusaders against Leeds Rhinos in August 2009 and joined Bradford Bulls in 2012.
"I've always wanted to play rugby union and to have signed for London Welsh and to play at the highest level is definitely something I've wanted to do for a long time. Hopefully now I can take my chance and be the best I can be.
"Everyone has the view we can still stay up - it only takes a few results. That's what we're searching for, a result, and hopefully we can get that on the weekend," he said.
Welsh, who were promoted in the summer, are yet to win a game this season, but head coach Justin Burnell is hopeful Kear can help them turn things around.
"Elliot had some excellent performances for Bradford in the Super League last year and won numerous man of the match awards, most notably against Wigan," he said.
"He's got a lot of pace and with our mounting injury list he's a fantastic addition to our squad."
