Malik says he missed the interview on NBC because of illness. During the appearance, the rest of One Direction were asked about rumours of substance abuse.
Speaking to The Sun, he said: "I was really ill, that's why I couldn't fly to America."
1D are promoting their new album Four.
In a broadcast from Orlando, host of the NBC Today show, Matt Lauer asked Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan about Zayn's absence: "There's been a lot of action on social media about him. Is it something more serious than a minor illness? There've been rumours of substance abuse. What's going on?"
Liam replied: "No. He's just got a stomach bug. He's OK. He's just at home. He just needs to rest." He added that he didn't know when Zayn would join the rest of the group.
One Direction appeared on the BBC Children In Need appeal on Friday night, performing their new song Night Changes live from the set of Eastenders.
On Saturday, the band joined stars including Rita Ora and Ed Sheeran to record the Band Aid 30 single.
In a statement, One Direction's management explained that Zayn had been too ill to fly to America on Sunday: Zayn was taken ill after recording the Band Aid single. He will join the band for promotion for the new album as soon as he possibly can.
Earlier this year, the singer was seen in a leaked video smoking what appeared to be a joint while the group travelled in a van in Peru.
Louis Tomlinson could be heard saying: "So here we are leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days."
One Direction consulted lawyers after the video emerged.
Possession of a small amount of cannabis is not illegal in Peru.
