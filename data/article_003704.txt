Zaneta Krokova, 11, and Helina Kotlarova, 12, were holding hands as they crossed a road in Oldham before they were hit on New Year's Eve.
Ahead of their funerals on Monday, Michaela Tarkaiova, the partner of Helina's brother, said the girls were "bright" and "everywhere together".
"We're feeling like something has broken inside us," she said.
"It has been really tough. The families - especially the mums of the two girls - are always crying.
"It's really sad and, to be honest, we haven't slept since that day… if we sleep, we sleep for maybe one or two hours… it's hard for us eat."
Ms Tarkaiova described Helina as a "happy" girl who "loved to eat, loved to dance, loved to sing".
She added: "She looked older, but inside she was still a child, she liked to play hide-and-seek."
Speaking on behalf of the families of both cousins, Ms Tarkaiova thanked members of the Oldham community who had provided help to the grieving relatives "financially, with their blessings, and everything".
"The pain what we're going through, they're feeling it with us," she said.
"They [Helina and Zaneta] have always been together and at the end of the day, they even died together and now they're in the coffins together, which is really sad."
Four men have been charged in relation to the crash.
