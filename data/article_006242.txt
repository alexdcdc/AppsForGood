Catrin Pugh, was on her way back from a ski season in the French Alps when the coach she was travelling in crashed and burst into flames.
The 22-year-old, from Rossett, Wrexham, was given a one in 1,000 chance of survival, spent three months in a coma and has had 200 operations since the French Alps crash in 2013.
She told BBC Radio 5 Live: “I remember being on fire, and having to have the flames stamped out – my skin was charred, and I thought I was going to die. I refused to close my eyes because I was afraid I wouldn’t wake up again.”
The settlement was reached with the owner of the coach firm.
