Garcia won Â£178,000 at the Asian Tour event despite losing a two-shot lead when he double-bogeyed the 17th.
The 35-year-old Spaniard beat India's Himmat Rai at the second extra hole after Thaworn Wiratchant and Lin Wen-tang had been eliminated at the first.
"I haven't won in a while and I was fortunate to get a second chance after I had given it away," Garcia said.
Garcia has 20 top-10 finishes in the major tournaments without winning one. His last tournament success was at the Qatar Masters in 2014.
After completing the 72 holes in 14-under, a 35-foot birdie at the first play-off hole kept Garcia in contention as Rai tapped in from five feet.
The Indian was out of contention soon afterwards as he drove into the bushes and was unable to recover.
"After you've been up there and don't win, a lot of things go through your mind," said Garcia.
"This win will help give me a little bit more confidence."
