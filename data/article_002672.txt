North West Ambulance Service said it received 3,827 calls on Monday, compared with 3,115 on the same day last year.
One caller rang to complain they had "heard their ankle crack".
The service said inappropriate calls increased waiting times for callers who genuinely needed help.
Other nuisance calls recorded over January and February included:
Ged Blezard, assistant director of operations, said: "I have worked in the ambulance service for 30 years and I cannot understand why people call us for minor ailments which can be easily dealt with [elsewhere].
"The ambulance service is not a taxi or mobile first aid service. We are here for life-threatening or potentially life-threatening emergencies."
