Fiona Thornewill, from Nottinghamshire, joined American climber Hans Florine for the ascent of "The Nose" of El Capitan in Yosemite, California.
Mr Florine jointly holds the record for the fastest ascent of The Nose, and this was his 100th attempt.
The pair were joined by writer and adventurer Jayme Moye.
Mrs Thornewill considers herself to be an amateur climber and did not intend to break the speed record of two hours and 23 minutes.
Writing on Facebook, her husband Mike Thornewill gave a "massive thank you" to Hans Florine.
"Both ladies have been very fortunate to share this gentleman's rope," he wrote.
"As well as leading the climb it should be remembered that Hans has pulled the heaviest bag and also carried the heaviest responsibility - for that the girls owe him a lot of beer."
Mrs Thornewill, 49, undertook the climb to celebrate her 50th year.
The ascent of the steep mountain face, called The Nose, is considered one of the most difficult rock climbs in the world as it rises almost a kilometre straight up from its base.
Ms Thornewill set the record for the fastest ski trek to the North Pole by a woman in 2001 at 56 days and was the fastest woman to reach the South Pole solo in just under 42 days in 2004.
She was appointed an MBE in the 2006 and was given an European Women of Achievement Award in 2004.
Her latest challenge has raised money for the BMC Access and Conservation Trust.
