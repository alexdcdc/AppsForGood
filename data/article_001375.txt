There will also be no direct trains between London Paddington and south Wales, with all services terminating at Bristol Parkway.
Buses will run between Bristol and Cardiff Central, and a shuttle train between the Welsh capital and Swansea.
It is expected to add up to 70 minutes to journeys between Swansea and Paddington.
Network Rail asked people to allow extra time to complete journeys.
