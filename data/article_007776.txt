Xabi Alonso has been banned from Real Madrid's next European match for his touchline celebration towards the end of last season's Champions League final win against Atletico. The Spanish midfielder was banned for the match and as such could not be on the bench but, when Gareth Bale scored what proved to be the winning goal, he ran down the touchline to join his team-mates in celebration. Atletico coach Diego Simeone has also been handed a one-match ban for his conduct towards Real defender Raphael Varane.
