A fire crew from Hatherleigh were sent to what they described as "old tin buildings" at Northlew near Okehampton at about 20:45 BST on Friday.
Firefighters said the man was trapped underneath galvanised roofing and debris, which they had to use tools to remove.
He was then taken to hospital by ambulance.
