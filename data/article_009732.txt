A committee found Gary Price sent information which unfairly and incorrectly portrayed what happened at a grievance appeal hearing in which he was a panel member.
The Llandrindod Wells North councillor did not attend the hearing on 2 November and has 21 days to appeal.
Conservative councillor Mr Price has been contacted for a comment.
In May 2013, he was suspended for a month following allegations he breached a code of conduct by disclosing "sensitive information which was given to him in confidence" in a letter he wrote to a newspaper.
