She has photographed some of the more colourful characters who shop on her high street in the Bristol suburb of Bedminster.
"A lot of people put a lot of effort into dressing up in Bedminster," she said, "I don't see it in other parts of Bristol."
"I often just ask people if I can take their picture because I really like their hat," she added.
An outdoor display of East Street Tales runs until October 22.
The photographer captures some of the characters she sees on a daily basis on East Street in Bedminster, including this man who takes his two pet chickens for a daily walk.
"I find myself going to people who dress differently but that doesn't give an overall picture of people in Bedminster. So there is a little bit of a dilemma as, being a photographer, I like to be objective," said Ibolya.
The BBC has gathered some of the most beautiful and interesting photographs from across England on its Pinterest board.
