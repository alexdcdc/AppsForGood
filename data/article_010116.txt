The 24-year-old is Forest's first signing since the Philippe Montanier's appointment as head coach on Monday.
Vellios had a three-and-a-half-year spell at Everton, but made just two Premier League starts for the club.
His previous time in England also included a loan spell at Blackpool, where he made two appearances.
Vellios joined Belgian side Lierse in 2014 and the following year he returned to Iraklis - the club where he started his career.
He scored 11 goals in the Greek Super League last season.
