Vassell, 23, joined Posh from Bishop's Stortford in 2013 and scored six goals in 36 games, but was loaned out Dagenham and Shrewsbury last season.
Versatile Daniel, 28, has spent time at Crewe, Macclesfield and Mansfield during his career.
Both players have agreed a one-year deal with the option of a further year.
They are the second and third signings for Gary Bowyer since becoming Blackpool boss after Jamille Matt joined from Lancashire rivals Fleetwood Town on Tuesday.
"With how football has gone for me in the last couple of years, this is probably the most important decision I've made in football. I'm delighted to be here," Vassell told the club website.
"It wasn't a hard decision for me. I want to come here, play well, win games, get promoted and score goals."
Daniel added: "Hopefully I can come here, do well for the team and we can push on for promotion and get this club back to where it should be."
