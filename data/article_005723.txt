The girl had been playing in a garden in the Carntyne area of the city at 19:00 on Thursday.
A Police Scotland spokesman said officers had attended after receiving a report of a man acting suspiciously towards a child.
"A 40-year-old man has been arrested and is subject to a report to the procurator fiscal," he said.
