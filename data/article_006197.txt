The Argentine, who has guided the club to second in the Premier League table, has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Paris St-Germain.
"It was an easy decision when you feel the love of the people and the potential of the club is massive, so why change?" he said.
Pochettino, 44, joined Tottenham in May 2014 after leaving Southampton.
"We create a good atmosphere on the training ground and I think we can achieve big things in the future," he added.
"I believe in this project and this club. I want to stay here."
Tottenham are still in with a slim chance of winning their first top-flight title since 1961, although a win for Leicester at Manchester United on Sunday would seal Claudio Ranieri's side an unlikely success.
Spurs are seven points behind the Foxes with three games remaining, but Pochettino has all but guaranteed the White Hart Lane club Champions League qualification for the first time since 2010.
Midfielder Dele Alli, 20, who will miss the rest of Spurs' season with a ban, was recently named PFA Young Player of the Year, while striker Harry Kane, 22, was also nominated for the main award.
Pochettino said the club has created "a great group of players" and called the staff and supporters "unbelievable".
"I wanted to stay for many reasons," the ex-Espanyol boss added. "We have a very strong squad, young, with potential to be a top team."
