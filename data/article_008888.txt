More than 800 writers, poets, illustrators, politicians, journalists, historians, scientists, philosophers and playwrights from 55 countries are to take part in the 17-day event at Charlotte Square Gardens.

The Good Wife actor Alan Cumming will preview his book You Gotta Get Bigger Dreams, a collection of anecdotes and photographs from the actor's time in Hollywood.
Comedian Sayle will read from his second memoir, Thatcher Stole My Trousers, in which he recounts his experiences with The Young Ones and The Comic Strip Presentsâ€¦
Tim Burgess will lift the lid on life with The Charlatans and their experiences at the heart of the 1990s 'Madchester' scene. He will be joined by crime writer and fellow music fan Ian Rankin to discuss their passion for vinyl.
In the non-fiction category, the festival will feature appearances by musicians Wilko Johnson and Brix Smith Start, as well as cyclists Chris Boardman and David Millar.
Politics and current affairs continue to play a key part in the programme.
