Lancashire-born "Typhoon" Tyson's Test career lasted less than five years, but in 17 Tests he captured 76 wickets at a remarkable average of 18.56.
He shone brightest as England won the 1954-55 Ashes series down under.
Chosen ahead of fellow quick bowler Fred Trueman, Tyson took 28 wickets in five Tests, including 7-27 in the second innings at Melbourne.

In terms of England bowling performances in the Ashes, that 7-27 has only since been bettered by two bowlers - spinner Jim Laker, who took 9-37 and 10-53 at Old Trafford in 1956, and paceman Stuart Broad who took 8-15 at Trent Bridge earlier this year.
After retiring at the age of 30 with 767 first-class wickets to his name, Tyson later emigrated to Australia, where he became a successful coach, commentator and writer.
Despite his injury-hit, relatively short international career, Tyson was hailed as the fastest bowler of his era by Australian legends Sir Donald Bradman and the late Richie Benaud, as well as his rival Trueman.
Former Australia batsman Dean Jones tweeted: "Sad to hear that Frank Tyson has passed away. Ex Vic coach. I was his student for a few of his books. Terrific cricketer. Terrific bloke."
