Championship runners-up Institute know they must score in Friday's match at Carrick as a 0-0 draw would be enough for the Premiership team on away goals
Institute scored in the 40th minute through a Michael McCrudden shot.
But Carrick equalised within two minutes with a Martin Murray penalty after a hand ball by Niall Grace.
Visiting skipper Michael Surgenor headed just wide from a corner in the second half while Carrick sub Fabio O'Brien headed in only to have it disallowed for offside.
In stoppage-time Murray shot just over for Carrick who may feel they have the slight edge going into the second leg.
Institute are hoping to make up for the disappointment of narrowly missing out in last year's play-off, when a stoppage-time goal saw them beaten 5-4 on aggregate by Ballinamallard United.
Carrick, meanwhile, are aiming to secure a third year in the top division, having won the Championship title in 2015.
"We are confident we can go up there and score a goal," said Institute manager Kevin Deery.
"The penalty set us back a bit going in at half-time, especially having played so well for so long.
"We probably just need to show a bit more composure on the ball."
