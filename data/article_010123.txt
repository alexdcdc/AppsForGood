The Imps, fresh from their fourth-round win over Championship leaders Brighton, started on the front foot with Jack Muldoon, Luke Waterfall and Elliot Whitehouse all spurning good opportunities in a goalless first period.
After the restart, Muldoon was denied by the feet of Solihull goalkeeper Nathan Baxter before eventually getting on the scoresheet, blasting in from close range.
Nathan Arnold went close to doubling their advantage, but saw his shot cleared off the line by a recovering Solihull defender.
The visitors then saw an equaliser rightly disallowed for handball deep in stoppage-time as Lincoln stretched their lead over Forest Green Rovers.
