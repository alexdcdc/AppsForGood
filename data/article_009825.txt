Warburton and assistant David Weir have agreed "significantly improved" deals to replace their previous contracts, which had two years left to run.
The 53-year-old Englishman said it was a "huge honour and privilege".
Delays to the negotiations with the club were interpreted in some quarters as a sign that Warburton might not be committed to staying at Ibrox.
But the man who led Rangers to the Scottish Championship title and the Scottish Cup final in his first season at Ibrox said: "All the speculation was due to a 12-day holiday. It was no more than that.
"'Why have you not signed?' Because I was away with the wife for 12 days.
"It's a privilege for me to be here in this position - and for David with his status at the club.
"It's a great place to be and we have extended for another year until 2019."
Warburton hopes the news will provide a boost for supporters and players days before their season kicks off with a Betfred Cup visit to Motherwell on Saturday.
More than 40,000 fans have already bought Ibrox season tickets for the Premiership campaign.
"It wasn't a distraction to me, but the stories just suddenly appeared," said the former Brentford boss.
"But the fact that season ticket sales are where they are shows the fantastic support and that the fans are excited for the season.
"And what we have to do is prepare well and hopefully the performances send them home happy."
Weir, 46, spent the last five years of his playing career at Ibrox, hanging up his boots in 2012.
"Mark and I have enjoyed every second of our time in Glasgow so far but the adventure is just beginning and we are all excited to start the new season," he told the club website.
"I told Mark what a unique and special club Rangers was before we started our work here and he has now experienced it for himself."
