Amy Brodie and Robyn Collins scored the Scots' goals to set up a last-four match with hosts Spain, who beat Ghana.
Scotland head coach Gordon Shepherd said: "The focus, concentration and application of the players was excellent.
"We're in the semi-finals and the focus on that game will start later today."
Czech Republic play Ukraine and Poland face Turkey in the remaining quarter-finals.
Meanwhile, Scotland men's head coach Derek Forsyth has named his squad for the three Test matches against France in Le Touquet from 12-17 February.
The games are the final part of the squad's preparation for World League 2, which takes place in Belfast from 11-19 March and where Scotland are in Pool B with France, Poland and Wales.
"The camp in France follows a good camp in Spain, and selection will be made following these two solid sets of test matches," said Forsyth.
