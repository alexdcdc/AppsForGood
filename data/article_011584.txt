The collection - housed in the south of Glasgow - has been closed to allow work on a multi-million pound project.
When it opens to visitors in 2020, the basement of the building will become part of the exhibition space.
The Burrell collection consists of more than 8,000 artefacts but fewer than a fifth of them have been on show at any one time.
The treasures were donated to the city by collector Sir William Burrell in 1944.
It is estimated that the total cost of the refurbishment project will be between Â£60m and Â£66m.
Under the modernisation plans, a new roof and high performance glazing will make the museum more energy-efficient.
Two new floors of exhibition space will be created so that 90% of the 8,000 objects can be viewed by the public.
Sir Angus Grossart, the chairman of Burrell Renaissance said: "The designs will see the museum undergo the most comprehensive modernisation since opening to international acclaim in 1983.
"The proposals will deliver the high quality and innovative solutions for this exciting project.
"We expect to be able to show previously unseen works from this rich collection, and strengthen the reach of this extraordinary world-class museum."
Architects John McAslan and Partners will work on the project.
Director Hannah Lawson said: "The Burrell provides an inspiring setting for shipping magnate Sir William Burrell's vast collection of art and antiquities within a category A listed building of international significance.
"John McAslan and Partners are delighted to be leading a team dedicated to the comprehensive repair and refurbishment of this architectural masterpiece.
"By providing a new circulation core we can open up new parts of the gallery to visitors and greatly increase the display area for the collections."
