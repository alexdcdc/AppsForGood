 Police in southern Sweden have caught an elderly woman growing cannabis at her home. 
  
 Officers in Gislaved raided the 90-year-old’s house, where they found marijuana growing in potplants. “I thought they were just rare plants,” she told officers at the time. Exactly how the police found out about the stash at her apartment remains unclear, reported the Expressen newspaper. An investigation has been launched as to where exactly the drugs came from and how they ended up in the pensioner’s home. It remains unknown if the woman will be charged for narcotic crimes, but such cases can be dropped if officials can’t prove intent.
