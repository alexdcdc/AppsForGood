Scott Coupland, 48, claimed his computer had crashed and he had lost vital information which meant his VAT returns ended up being for the wrong amounts.
He was found guilty by a jury after a four day trial at Perth Sheriff Court.
Coupland, 48, of Crieff, made two false VAT repayment claims between March 2011 and November 2012.
The trial heard that Coupland, sole director of WDR Coupland (Produce) Ltd, aroused suspicion because of the large sums he claimed to have made in net value sales.
Sheriff William Wood said Coupland had made no attempt to pay back the money he had fraudulently obtained and had to go to jail despite his previous good character and service to the community.
Coupland was found guilty of submitting false repayment claims for £124,172 between 1 March 2011 and 6 June 2012.
He was also found guilty of submitting a false claim for £37,056 between 1 June and 30 November 2012.
Coupland offered to pay back £20,000 in an attempt to avoid a prison sentence but Sheriff Wood noted that no money had been paid back in four years.
The sheriff said: "I take into account the fact your business was a legitimate one and I dare say claims were made to fund your lifestyle and continue your children's education.
"It should have been clear your business was failing. You had a somewhat cavalier approach to corporate accounting.
"You have shown no remorse or acceptance of culpability and made no offer of restitution until today.
"I appreciate the impact this will no doubt have on your family, but I will sentence you to two years and six months imprisonment.
"You bear sole responsibility for these offences."
