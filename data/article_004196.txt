The BHA says 30% of jockeys who attend licensing courses never ride a winner, despite money being spent on training.
From 1 April, apprentice or conditional jockeys applying to attend a course must undergo a pre-licence assessment.
Training places for apprentices will fall to 24 from 48, while conditional places will drop to 16 from 40.
The move follows a three-year review.
"The changes ensure our jockeys will have access to significantly enhanced technical, personal and professional training," said BHA chief executive Nick Rust.
"A more efficient and extensive assessment process can help aspiring jockeys who have a genuine chance of success to receive the first-class levels of support and guidance they require."
The BHA strategy involved input from the Professional Jockeys' Association, National Trainers' Federation and Jockeys' Employment and Training Scheme.
