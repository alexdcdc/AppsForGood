Vinales, 22, eased to victory after reigning champion Marc Marquez crashed out on lap four while leading the race.
Victory extends the Yamaha rider's championship lead, having also won the season opener in Qatar in March.
Crutchlow, who qualified in third, moved up to second but was passed by Valentino Rossi on lap 19 of 25.
Honda rider Crutchlow, 31, was unable to close down nine-time world champion Rossi in the final stages and had to settle for third on the podium.
Italian Rossi, 38, claimed his second straight podium of the season in his 350th grand prix start.
Jorge Lorenzo's struggles at new team Ducati continued as the 29-year-old three-time MotoGP champion crashed out on the first corner, following a disappointing 11th-placed finish in Qatar.
Vinales now has a maximum 50 points from two rounds, 14 points ahead of Yamaha team-mate Rossi.
