The PSNI, Coroner and Prisoner Ombudsman have launched investigations into the death.
Prison Service Director General Sue McAllister said: "I extend my sympathy and that of the Northern Ireland Prison Service to the family of the prisoner who has died.
"This is a tragedy and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time."
A Prison Service statement added that â€Ž"while investigations are ongoing it would be inappropriate to provide any further comment".
