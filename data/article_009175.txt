It is alleged Michael Ohaegbu grabbed her off a Hull street last September.
He denies attempted kidnap, assault, and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence.
The 42-year-old also pleaded not guilty at Hull Crown Court to three counts of voyeurism, which relate to another complainant.

Mr Ohaegbu, of Chestnut Avenue, who worked at Castle Hill Hospital, is accused of twice filming the second complainant naked, and once under a table at a restaurant, without her consent between July and August 2016.
The court was told, that on 26 September, the teenager was walking along Peel Street after midnight when Mr Ohaegbu tried to kidnap her.
On the opening day of the trial, prosecutor Charlotte Baines said: "These, say the prosecution were the tools, you may conclude, that the defendant had in his vehicle with his intention of committing a sexual offence that night.
"It is the prosecution's case that the defendant has committed a number of offences against both of these females.
"All of them were planned by the defendant, albeit concerning completely separate complainants, and are separated by time, but they have common features, and were offences carried out against their consent, and were motivated by the defendant's sexual gratification."
The jury heard, that when questioned by police officers following his arrest, Mr Ohaegbu said the condoms were from a health centre and the Vaseline was for dry skin because he showered a lot.
The trial continues.
