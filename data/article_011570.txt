Kevin Scott, from Lincoln, and the UK Monowheel Team broke the previous record of 57mph (91.7km/h) set by Kerry McClean in the US in 2001.
The record, included in the 2017 Guinness World Records book, was set at Elvington Airfield, near York, in 2015.
Mr Scott said recording a new fastest speed was "absolutely fantastic".
