A senior DUP source said it was a heart-related condition.
A party spokesman confirmed that the party leader felt unwell on Monday morning.
"He has been admitted to the hospital for some further tests," the spokesman said.  It is understood Mr Robinson, who is 66 years old, was taken by ambulance to hospital.
He has served as first minister in Northern Ireland since 2008.
There are no further details about his condition.
