Calle Jarnkrok opened the scoring for the hosts at Bridgestone Arena before Sidney Crosby equalised for Pittsburgh.
Frederick Gaudreau and Viktor Arvidsson then struck for Nashville in the second period, before Filip Forsberg fired into an empty net late on.
Predators goaltender Pekke Rinne made 23 saves to secure back-to-back victories over the defending champions.
Nashville are playing in their first Stanley Cup final since their inception in 1998.
Game five takes place in Pittsburgh on Thursday (01:00 BST on Friday).
Prior to the game, Predators coach Peter Laviolette asked fans to stop throwing dead catfish onto the ice - a tradition that dates back to 2003.
Instead, a catfish wearing a blue hat, wrapped in a Predators towel and with a toy penguin stuffed in its mouth was thrown onto the ice before the start of the game.
Staff also had to clear other catfish off the ice during the game.
Five were thrown during Nashville's 5-1 victory in game three, while play was delayed to remove a catfish in game one at Pittsburgh's PPG Paints Arena.
