Windsor's Theatre Royal was celebrating the opening night of One Man, Two Guvnors on Tuesday evening.
But theatre-goers were swiftly removed after flash-flooding caused water to halt the performance.
The theatre director Robert Miles said the auditorium had since been dried out and Wednesday night's show would continue as planned.
Sue Salmon, who was in the auditorium when the theatre was evacuated, said: "Water was just pouring under the doors down towards the stage."
The play, performed by the Windsor Repertory Company, is part of a six-week festival celebrating 201 years of theatre in the Berkshire town.
The flood happened after heavy rainfall on Tuesday, which also caused havoc in London where some people were trapped in cars by flash flooding.
Mr Miles said: "Nothing like this has happened to us before, we've had the occasional flood as we've been here 100 years.
"All of a sudden water started coming through from the back of the building and it didn't take long for it to get into the auditorium."
Wendy Sammes went to see the play with her daughter. She said: "It was a horrific storm, you could hear the thunder and lightning in the theatre.
"We suddenly saw people standing up [in the front stalls] and were evacuated."
