Mr Langley had been serving as the force's acting deputy, having been assistant chief constable in charge of all operational matters.
He started his career with Devon and Cornwall Police in 1989 and in 2008 moved to Lincolnshire Police.
Mr Langley said he was "excited and honoured" to be appointed the new deputy chief constable.
He added: "Dyfed Powys is an excellent force and over the last two years I have got to know a lot of officers and staff and I have seen their commitment and hard work to bring about justice, and to deliver services that are truly customer focused.
"I look forward to continuing the work that is already underway to ensure that we put the public at the heart of all that we do, and ensure that everyone receives the quality of service that they are entitled to expect from their police force."
Chief Constable Simon Prince said Mr Langley had already proved himself as "an asset to the force with the work he undertook on operational policing whilst assistant chief constable".
