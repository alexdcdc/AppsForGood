Austria's leader, Chancellor Werner Faymann, said the subsidies should support "new and modern technology" in the interest of all EU states.
But he argued this subsidy does not apply to atomic energy "in any way".
EDF Energy said Hinkley is an appropriate way for the UK to meet its need for low carbon electricity.
An EDF spokesperson said: "The agreements... are durable because they are fair and balanced.
"They were approved by the European Commission following a robust and lengthy investigation.
"It found that the agreements were an appropriate and proportionate way for the UK to meet its need for secure, low carbon electricity. "
The Austrians argued a deal by the UK government to guarantee the price of electricity from the nuclear plant breaches European rules on state aid.
But last October, the European Commission said the deal was within EU rules.
The power station, near Bridgwater in Somerset, is due to be up-and-running by 2023.
