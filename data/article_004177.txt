Sam Pickering, 20, is thought to have lost control of his Yamaha motorbike in Oughtibridge on Sunday.
He was on his way to the bikers' charity egg run for Sheffield Children's Hospital when he crashed.
His mother said he was a "beautiful son" and fellow bikers revved their engines at the event in his honour.
Organised by Three Shires Honda Owners Club, the egg runs have been held for 15 years and raised more than Â£40,000 for the Children's Hospital Charity.

"Easter Sunday 2017 will be a day never to be forgotten as it is the day my beautiful son, Sam, lost his life whilst on his way to attend the charity egg run for the Sheffield Children's Hospital along with his step-dad," his mother said in a statement.
"Sam was a loud and proud person with a huge personality. He always had a smile on his face and only ever wanted to do good in life."
"I will never forget you and we will love you forever," the statement added.
A minute's silence followed by 30 seconds of revving was held at the start of the event, after organisers became aware of Mr Pickering's fatal crash.
Mr Pickering's father, Stephen, said: "He was my son and friend and I will miss him."
Officers are investigating and have asked for anyone with information to contact them.
