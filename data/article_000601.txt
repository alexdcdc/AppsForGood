The Burrell Collection will shut on Sunday evening and will reopen in 2020 after the multi-million pound redevelopment is complete.
This weekend the museum is hosting a range of free activities including live music, a family ceilidh, and guided tours.
The building is said to be no longer fit for purpose and needs a new roof.
The Burrell Collection, in the heart of Pollok Country Park, opened to the public in 1983.
Only a fifth of the collection, donated to the city by collector Sir William Burrell in 1944, is currently on display as many items have had to be removed to protect them from damage.
It is estimated that the total cost of the project will be between £60m and £66m.
Under the modernisation plans, a new roof and high performance glazing will make the museum more energy-efficient.
Two new floors of exhibition space will be created so that 90% of the 8,000 objects can be viewed by the public.
Throughout the Burrell's refurbishment, some of the works from its collection will be on display at Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery in Glasgow.
Burrell at Kelvingrove will showcase a series of changing displays, providing visitors continued access to treasures from the collection.
The first exhibition 'Burrell at Kelvingrove: Joseph Crawhall', will offer visitors a rare opportunity to see 23 of the finest works by one of the radical group of young Scottish painters, the Glasgow Boys. It will run from 24 October, 2016 until July next year.
