Holyrood's Public Audit Committee previously heard how seven staff received payouts totalling £849,842.
Auditor General Caroline Gardner said she believed the chair of the board and the principal had worked together and withheld concerns over the payments.
Both have been invited to appear before the Public Audit Committee.
It has not been confirmed if they will accept the invitation.
In June, the auditor general issued a highly-critical report of the severance deals paid out before the college become part of New College Lanarkshire last year.
New College Lanarkshire was formed by a merger of Motherwell, Cumbernauld and Coatbridge Colleges.
In her report, Ms Gardner stated that a total of 39 staff left from the former Coatbridge College at a cost of £1.7m.
Of this, £849,842 of this went on seven staff - former college principal John Doyle, a member of his staff and five senior managers.
Ms Gardner said in her report that the senior staff received payments "that exceeded the terms of the college's severance scheme".
When the report was discussed by Holyrood's Public Audit Committee last month, MSP Nigel Don said the case was a "particularly bad example of misuse of funds, deliberate withholding of information and of feathering one's own nest".
