The UK Championship was held at the venue for 20 years but left in 1997.
"I will be looking at it and evaluating the audience figures on TV as that is important to my sponsors," Hearn told BBC Radio Lancashire.

Former world champion John Higgins, who played in the 1996 UK Championship final in Preston, would like to see more snooker played at the venue.

"This was here well before the York Barbican Centre and Alexandra Palace but sadly it is not used on the rota.
