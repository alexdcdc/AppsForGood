The charity's offices in Cardiff and Prestatyn received separate calls from boys who were worried about the effect pornography was having on them.
ChildLine has launched a campaign to tackle what it calls the "shocking" number of 12 to 13-year-olds afraid they are "addicted to porn".
One of the Welsh youngsters said pornography made him feel "perverted".
The children's counselling charity - which is calling its campaign the Fight Against Porn Zombies - said a UK-wide poll of 700 children showed that one in five had seen pornographic images that shocked or upset them.
One boy who spoke with a counsellor at the charity's Cardiff base said: "I've started to view girls a bit differently recently and it's making me worried.
"I would like to get married in the future but I'm scared it might never happen if I carry on thinking about girls the way I do."
Another youngster who contacted the Prestatyn office said: "I can't help looking at girls in a sexual way and I think it's because I watch a lot of porn."
Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service for Wales, said: "Children of all ages today have easy access to a wide range of pornography and if we as a society shy away from talking about this issue, then we are failing the thousands of young people it is affecting."
