In March 2015, thousands flocked to Leicester as the king's remains were escorted to the city's cathedral.
The windows, which cost Â£75,000, are located near Richard III's tomb in the cathedral's St. Katharine's Chapel.
A reverend called the dedication of the windows the "final act" in the story of the king's reinterment.
The windows are approximately 2.5m (8ft 2ins) and 1m (3ft 2ins) high and were designed by stained glass artist Thomas Denny.
They were previously plain glass and had been for about 100 years, according to the Reverend Pete Hobson.
"It's not just telling Richard III's story," he said. "It's helping the person who sees them reflect on the questions of life and death that are raised by the life and death of Richard III."
One of the pictures shows a forlorn, blue figure, which represents personal loss, inspired by the loss felt by the king after the death of his son Edward and wife Anne Neville.
Another depicts women tending to people in the aftermath of battle.
"It's a big day," Mr Hobson said. "It'll be the final act of the story of the reinterment of Richard for us."
Richard was buried in a Leicester church, but the building was lost to later development. His skeleton was found in 2012 in an old friary beneath a car park.
His remains were the subject of a High Court battle in 2014. A group unsuccessfully argued the remains should have been reburied in York.
