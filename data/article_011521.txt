The pair were seen dodging seawater as waves hit the breakwater at Porthcawl as it got dark on Sunday.
Phil Norman, duty controller for the UK Coastguard, said the images were "alarming".
People have been urged to avoid rough seas after six people died around Britain at the weekend.
"The seas have been unforgiving this weekend and we cannot stress enough that piers, rocks, harbours and the water's edge are not safe places to be when the weather is bad," Mr Norman said.
"Playing chicken with waves is extremely dangerous. It can be slippery and because there is little to hold on to even a small wave can come out of nowhere and quickly wash you off and into the sea.
"These people are incredibly lucky to be alive."
The breakwater, which has a Victorian lighthouse, is a popular place to watch large waves crash in stormy weather.
Elizabeth Moore, 54, who was visiting the area, said: "There were about 20 people watching the waves from a safe distance, it was getting dark and quite dramatic.
"But we were horrified when these young lads walked along the breakwater in such dangerous conditions.
"People were shouting at them to get back but they couldn't hear because of the noise of the waves."
Mrs Moore said two other boys also joined in, adding: "They were trying to get closer and closer to the point where the waves were hitting with the maximum force.
"I couldn't watch at one point, I thought they were going to get swept away. They must have thought so too because they were clinging on to each other."
