Following the magistrate's decision, Rurik Jutting's lawyer said the next hearing could be in four to six weeks.
Mr Jutting was arrested after police found the bodies, one in a suitcase, at his apartment in Wan Chai in November.
This was Mr Jutting's first opportunity to enter a plea; something he declined to do.
He is charged with the murders of Sumarti Ningsih on 27 October and Seneng Mujiasih on 1 November.
The former-banker arrived in court wearing a black T-shirt with the words New York on the front and back. It appeared to be the same shirt he has worn to all of his court appearances to date. He also appeared noticeably thinner than when he was arrested last year.
Mr Jutting spoke three times at the committal hearing.
He said "I do" twice to indicate he understood the legal proceedings explained by the magistrate.
When asked if he wished to enter a plea, he said: "I have no plea at this time."
If he had pleaded guilty the case would have gone straight to sentencing.
Police had been called to Mr Jutting's property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Ms Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks.
She died a short time later. The body of Ms Ningsih, 23, was found in the suitcase.
The two women were in Hong Kong as domestic workers but were working in the sex trade.
Cambridge-educated Mr Jutting was ruled mentally fit to stand trial for the murders after undergoing psychiatric tests.
He moved to Hong Kong from London in July 2013 and is understood to have quit his highly-paid job in the days before the incident.
