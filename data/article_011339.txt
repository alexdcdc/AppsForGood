Ibrar Ali, from Selby, North Yorkshire, was injured by a road-side bomb in Iraq and lost his lower right arm, but re-trained and returned to active service.
He was part of the Walking with the Wounded trip which trekked to the South Pole with Prince Harry in 2013.
The seven-day challenge finished on Manly beach, Sydney, Australia.
The endeavour had started on 23 January in Antarctica.
Mr Ali, originally from Rotherham in South Yorkshire, who left the Army in 2013, finished alongside RAF veteran Luke Wigman.
Mr Ali finished the challenge with a final four-hour marathon as the sun was rising over Manly beach, he wrote on social media.
"All the support from family and friends has kept us moving when our bodies really wanted to give up", he said.
Mr Ali added: "For Luke and I to complete this shows that rehab works but it needs to be better. That's why I did this crazy challenge - to get word out about the DNRC for current and future servicemen and women."
The challenge involved 295km of running and 59 hours of flight time.

Money raised through the challenge is to help fund the Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre, being built near Loughborough that is to open in 2018.
