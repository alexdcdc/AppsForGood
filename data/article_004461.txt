Kieran Agard's turn and shot opened the scoring for the Millers.
Bradford thought they had levelled shortly after but James Hanson's header was ruled out for a foul.
Alex Revell then turned home a Michael O'Connor free-kick to double the hosts' lead before Agard added his second with a close-range looping header.

"It was a thoroughly professional performance, it could have been more and perhaps should have been more.
"The training ground work that these have put in for the last three or four days, long days for them, has been worthwhile.
"Alex is a super player. If he scored goals he would be playing at the top of the Championship. He destroyed their back two."
