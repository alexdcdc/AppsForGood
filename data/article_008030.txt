Bewl Valley Sailing Club, on the Kent and Sussex border, said its Â£160,000 rent was untenable and it was technically insolvent.
It was handed over to administrator White Maund on 17 July, but has now announced it has been able to reopen.
Rowing and canoe clubs will continue to be based at the Lamberhurst site too.
Greg Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, welcomed the return of sailing on Bewl Water.
He said: "Bewl Water is an important local recreational centre and it was regrettable that the sailing club went into administration.
"I am pleased that Bewl Water Boating has acted to get sailing back up and running again during this summer - for many local people boating at Bewl is an important pastime."
