Scans revealed the 23-year-old ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and he will have an operation next week.
Wilson had made an impressive start to life in the Premier League, scoring five goals in seven games.
He scored a hat-trick in a 4-3 win against West Ham in August.
"It's very disappointing for Callum, after what has been an exceptional start to the season, but I am sure he will come back fitter and stronger," said Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.
"Callum is the type of character who won't be fazed by such a setback, and I am sure he will turn this experience into a positive in the long run.
"As I have said many times before though, this kind of setback offers others the opportunity to step up to the plate, show everybody what they can do and make a real impact at this level."
The news is the latest blow for the Cherries following long-term injuries to defender Tyrone Mings and winger Max Gradel.
