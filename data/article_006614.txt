The Holst Birthplace Museum in Cheltenham has been closed for repairs since June, when water poured through the roof and badly damaged three rooms.
A fundraising campaign was launched in the summer, with the repairs costing around Â£30,000.
Holst was born on 21 September 1874 and is best known for his work The Planets.
Sara Salvidge, from the museum, said there had been very heavy rain and she had been concerned with the yard flooding and water coming through a downstairs door.
"I said I'd just check the loft before we go, I went up there and it was like a waterfall, it was horrendous," she said.
"[Downstairs] there was a massive blister of water behind the wallpaper and that held back some of the water - but the water was falling behind the painting... but also running along the ceiling and pouring down on to a regency sofa which was there."
