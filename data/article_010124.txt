The Manchester United player - an integral part of England's Euro 2016 team - gave a thumbs-up sign as he appeared to limp off the team bus.
Smalling is one of only three recognised central defenders in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad.
England's first match in Group B is against Russia on Saturday [20:00 BST].
Meanwhile, Daniel Sturridge says age is no barrier to success at Euro 2016.
With an average age of 25, England have the youngest squad at the tournament, but Sturridge believes that is a "strength not a weakness".
He also insisted England's older players will not be scarred by previous failures in major tournaments.
"We know there will be a lot of eyes on us," said the Liverpool forward. "I think we will enjoy the occasion and thrive."
Asked if England were favourites to win Euro 2016, which is being held in France, he added: "I think that is down to everyone else to decide."
Hodgson's side failed to make it past the group stages at the 2014 World Cup and were knocked out at the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 by Italy.
As England prepare for their opening Euro 2016 match against Russia on Saturday, Ryan Bertrand trained separately from the main squad on Tuesday.
The Southampton full-back, who missed the final warm-up game against Portugal last week with an unspecified injury, worked separately with physio Gary Lewin at England's base in Chantilly.
After facing Russia, Roy Hodgson's side come up against Wales and Slovakia in their other Group B games in France.
