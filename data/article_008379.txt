Aaron William Luxton, 31, of Alexander Park, Newtownards, is also accused of having nine movie files of children being sexually abused.
Mr Luxton is alleged to have committed the offences on dates between 16 October 2009 and 24 September 2013.
No facts of the case were outlined at Newtownards Magistrates Court. The defendant made no comment.
Mr Luxton faces six counts of having prohibited images of children and 26 further offences of making and possessing indecent images of children, encompassing both still photographs and movie files.
A defence lawyer told the court she had no contrary submissions regarding whether there was a case for Mr Luxton to answer.
Mr Luxton was freed on continuing bail to appear in court again later this month.
