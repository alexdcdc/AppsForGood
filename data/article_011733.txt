The victim was targeted as she walked along Balmoral Road in Dumfries at about 14:50 on New Year's Day.
The cyclist snatched the woman's handbag, knocking her to the ground, before cycling off.
The woman was taken to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary where she was treated for fractures to her arm.
Officers have been reviewing CCTV footage of the area and have appealed for information.
Det Sgt Colin McKinstry said: "Targeting an elderly woman as she walks along the street is a despicable act and it's imperative we trace the person responsible.
"We know from our inquiries carried out so far that several people stopped to assist the lady and I am appealing to them and anyone else who was in the vicinity at the time of the incident to contact us.
"The information you provide could prove vital in helping us trace the person responsible and holding them to account for their cowardly act."
The suspect was riding a dark bike and was dressed in dark clothing with a hood up. It is not known whether they were male or female.
