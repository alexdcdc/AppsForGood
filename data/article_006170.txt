The blaze at Clandon Park House on Wednesday left the structure gutted.
The National Trust-owned Grade I-listed property, near Guildford, is a popular wedding venue, with 27 weddings due to take place there in 2015.
The trust said a "significant amount" of the mansion's collection had been saved from the fire.
However, it is still not known what caused it or whether the house can be restored.
A Surrey County Council spokesman said: "Following the devastating fire at Clandon Park, we've done all we can to ensure two weddings due to take place this weekend can proceed at alternative venues on the days the couples intended.
'We've applied to the General Register Office for the wedding notice period to be waived and we'll also be contacting other couples who have booked ceremonies at Clandon Park to give them any advice and support they need."
About 80 firefighters tackled the blaze at its height and crews managed to save a number of valuable antiques, which have now been put into storage.
