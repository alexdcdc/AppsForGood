Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Ever wonder who's more stupid: Justin Bieber's followers or Ashton Kutcher's? Well, wonder no more â€” there's a new app in town that will gauge Twitter idiocy for you. 
  
  
  
 Tom Scott, of Tweleted fame, has come out with a new website called Stupid Fight that measures the mental capacity of someone's Twitter followers by sifting through the last 100 people to @ reply to the person in question. According to the site's FAQs: 
  
 "It estimates based on several stupid indicators. Are they using twenty exclamation marks in a row? Do they endlessly use the abbreviation 'OMG'? Do they seem incapable of working out where their Shift key is? These indicators have a strong correlation with the message, and its sender, being stupid." 
  
 Scott hypes the site as a way to determine how stupid the followers of celebs are, but it works just as well with your personal Twitter account. We pit Bieber and Kutcher against each other below as a test. Seeing as how "Justin Bieber" is an extremely popular trending topic, the results are actually quite worrisome.
