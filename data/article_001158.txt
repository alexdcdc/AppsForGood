Evans is expected to be named on Friday in Michael O'Neill's squad for the World Cup qualifier with Norway in Belfast on 26 March.
The 26-year-old has been sidelined since 2 January because of a chronic groin problem.
Evans has started his country's last two World Cup qualifiers.
New Rovers manager Mowbray made it clear there would be no club-versus-country row if Evans were to face the Norwegians.
"I don't really get involved in the international set-ups. What I do know is footballers like to play for their countries, they want to play for their countries," he said.
"If he gets called up, there will no problem. If anything it will be a benefit if he gets some game time and some intense training to build him up.
"He has trained with us for almost a week now. I would have to say he looks a very talented footballer, my type of footballer. He picks really lovely passes, he's got quick feet and a really good appreciation of the football.
"He needs to get fit. If he gets called up, there will no problem."
Former Celtic boss Mowbray was appointed Blackburn manager on 22 February, succeeding Owen Coyle.
