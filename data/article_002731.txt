The university is now ranked 33rd in the UK and is the sole representative from Wales in the top 200 world rankings.
Swansea University was ranked 41st in the UK, up two places.

Aberystwyth University is up from 93rd to 79th, while Cardiff Metropolitan University is 103rd, University of South Wales 112th and Glyndwr University 122nd.
The Sunday Times said University of Wales Trinity Saint David was not included in its league table as it did not release the data the guide uses for its rankings.
The guide's league table is compiled using a number of criteria including student satisfaction, research quality, academic peer review, entrance qualifications held by new students, degree results achieved, drop-out rates and graduate employment levels.
