The 38-year-old, who left Scottish League One rivals Albion Rovers at the end of the season, takes over after Barry Smith moved to Raith Rovers.
Albion had said with two games left of the season that Young would leave after they failed to agree a new contract.
Young became player-manager in Coatbridge in 2014 and led his side to the League Two title.
They finished sixth in League One last season and eighth in the campaign just finished - four points and three places below East Fife.
Smith had taken charge of the Fifers in December after Gary Naysmith moved to Championship outfit Queen of the South.
The former Dundee manager will now be in opposition to his previous club next season after Raith were relegated from the second tier under John Hughes.
Brian Kerr, who had been Albion's youth boss, was named as Young's replacement two days after the end of the season.
