However, his move will not go through until after the Buddies face Queen of the South in the Scottish Championship on Saturday.
Storie, 20, has previously been loaned to Forfar Athletic and Brechin City.
"We've watched him several times and we're delighted to have him on board until the end of the season," manager Jack Ross told the St Mirren website.
"We feel like we needed a player in that area of the pitch and Craig is someone who I've admired as a player for quite a while."
The Paisley side are bottom of the Championship, seven points below Ayr United.
Scotland Under-21 international Storie, who has 28 senior club appearances, could make his St Mirren debut away to Dunfermline Athletic on 14 January.
He joins another Aberdeen youngster, 21-year-old striker Lawrence Shankland, on loan at the Buddies.
However, Rangers pair Tom Walsh and Ryan Hardie have ended their loan spells at the Paisley 2021 Stadium, the latter having started a new loan spell at Raith Rovers.
