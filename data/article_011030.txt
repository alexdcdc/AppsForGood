Helen Hinks, of Talybont, and her son William, three, discovered it while walking along Borth beach in February.
The boat travelled 4,000 miles across the Atlantic after being launched by schoolchildren in South Carolina in May 2015.
Parts for the vessel have arrived from the US and parents and pupils from Borth Primary will try to rebuild it.
Youngsters at St Andrew's School of Math and Science in Charleston made it as part of a school project and named it the Carolina Dreamer.
It was fitted with a GPS tracker, which showed it had washed up in Bermuda, before being re-launched.
Mrs Hinks described work to repair it as "an inspiring project", with a new fibre glass top and sail recently arriving from St Andrew's School.
"We were really excited to open the box and see the parts had arrived and the children from the school had all written good luck messages," she said.
The plan is to re-launch it from the west coast of Ireland in July.
