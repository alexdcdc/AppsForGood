 News Corp has come under global condemnation for publishing a racist, sexist cartoon depicting Serena Williams in its Melbourne paper. 
  
 The cartoon by Mark Knight, published in Rupert Murdoch’s Herald Sun tabloid on Tuesday, depicted the tennis star having a tantrum on the court at the US Open after she lost to Naomi Osaka on Saturday. The depiction of Osaka has also been criticised as making her appear as a “white woman”. 
  
 The way Knight drew Williams has been compared to the racist illustrations ubiquitous during the US Jim Crow era and Sambo cartoons. 
  
 Condemnation of the cartoon has come from American civil rights activist the Rev Jesse Jackson, British author JK Rowling and numerous sports broadcasters, journalists and activists. 
  
 Speaking on ABC, Knight said he had “no knowledge of those cartoons or that period” and he thought the said people were “making stuff up”.

 “I’m upset that people are offended, but I’m not going to take the cartoon down,” he said. 
  
 “I can’t undraw the cartoon. I think people have just misinterpreted. Maybe there’s a different understanding of cartooning in Australia to America … It was a cartoon based on her tantrum on the day and that’s all it was.” 
  
 The National Association of Black Journalists said the cartoon was “repugnant” on many levels. 
  
 “The Sept 10 cartoon not only exudes racist, sexist caricatures of both women, but Williams’ depiction is unnecessarily sambo-like,” the association said. 
  
 “The art of editorial cartooning is a visual dialogue on the issues of the day, yet this cartoon grossly inaccurately depicts two women of colour at the US Open, one of the grandest stages of professional sports.” 
  
 Bernice King, the chief executive of the King Center and daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, said the Herald Sun’s stance was “unfortunate”. 
  
 It was “without consideration for the painful historical context of such imagery and how it can support biases and racism today”, she said. “Why wouldn’t a human being care about that?” 
  
 Be A King (@BerniceKing) So unfortunate that this is your response; and without consideration for the painful historical context of such imagery and how it can support biases and racism today. Why wouldn’t a human being care about that? 
  
 The Washington Post noted Knight drew Williams with facial features that reflected caricatures common in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
  
 “Knight’s cartoon conjures up a range of such caricatures that were branded on memorabilia and popularized on stage and screen of the era, including the minstrel-show character Topsy born out of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’, as well as the title character in 1899’s ‘Little Black Sambo’,” the article said. 
  
 In an article published by the Herald Sun, Knight said he was “amazed” at the reaction, and said his cartoon was “not about race”. 
  
 “The world has gone crazy,” he said. Knight said reaction on social media was “unfair”. 
  
 “I tried to reply to these people but they just don’t listen,” he said. “On any given day you are a hero and on any given day you are a pariah. And you just have to live with it.” 
  
 Knight had publicly replied to one person on Twitter – US sportswriter Julie DiCaro – seeking an apology for her suggestion it was sexist. 
  
 Mark Knight (@Knightcartoons) Well Julie here’s a cartoon I drew a few days before when Australian male tennis player Kyrgios at the US Open was behaving badly. Don’t bring gender into it when it’s all about behaviour. I’ll accept your apology in writing😁 pic.twitter.com/NLV0AjPGsY 
  
  
  
 The executive chairman of News Corp Australia, Michael Miller, said criticism of Knight “shows the world has gone too PC”. 
  
 Michael Miller (@mm_newscorpaus) Criticism of Mark Knight's Serena Williams cartoon shows the world has gone too PC & misunderstands the role of news media cartoons and satire. Poor behaviour in any sport needs to be called out. #media #cartoons #markknight @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun https://t.co/KQFuvIJp0Q pic.twitter.com/sRo3AQ1cJW 
  
 Editor of the Herald Sun, Damon Johnston, also defended Knight. 
  
 “A champion tennis player had a mega tantrum on the world stage, and Mark’s cartoon depicted that,” Johnston said. “It had nothing to do with gender or race.” 
  
 The Herald Sun article ended with a series of other recent Knight cartoons, but did not include one from last month about Sudanese-Australian violence in Melbourne, which also sparked accusations of racism.

 NUFF (@nuffsaidny) The saddest part about Mark Knight’s cartoon depiction of Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, is that he believes that he has done nothing wrong and that everyone is overreacting and does not understand the art of caricature. Racist bigotry at its finest.

 The cartoon, published yesterday, has been widely criticised as “racist” and “vile” by The Washington Post, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, rapper Nicki Minaj and Australian comedian Eddie Perfect, amongst others. 
  
 “They are wrong,” Neil Mitchell said. 
  
 “I will say when I looked at the cartoon, it didn’t even cross my mind it was meant to be racially offensive. 
  
 “It was a sports bully, throwing a tantrum.” 
  
 Mark Knight told Neil he never expected this to happen. 
  
 “The world’s gone crazy,” he said. 
  
 “It’s a cartoon about poor behaviour. 
  
 “It’s nothing to do with race. 
  
 “I drew this cartoon on Monday night, I saw the world’s greatest tennis player spit the dummy. 
  
 “She’s great to draw, she’s a powerful figure, she’s strongly built. 
  
 “I’m sorry it’s been taken by social media and distorted so much. 
  
 “I’ve tried to reply to these people but they don’t listen.”

 To all my non-Australian friends and followers; we all think Mark Knight is a racist asshole too. — Eddie Perfect (@Eddieperfect) September 10, 2018 ||||| "It’s pretty wild that a major Australian paper will run a cartoon that wouldn’t be out of place in a 19th century periodical." 
  
 A cartoon from Friday’s edition of Melbourne’s Herald Sun featuring caricatured, rioting African teens has been branded as racist. 
  
 Here’s the cartoon, drawn by award-winning cartoonist Mark Knight: 
  
 The cartoon pictures Victorian Labor MP Jacinta Allan standing on a train station. Behind her, African teens are fighting and causing destruction. 
  
 The cartoon is captioned “minister Jacinta Allan takes decisive action to keep the Victorian public safe… and bans Sky News on city stations.” 
  
 Allan was under fire this week after she announced that she would stop Sky News from broadcasting in Victorian train stations. She made the move after Sky presenter Adam Giles held an interview with far right ringleader Blair Cottrell. 
  
 I’ve directed @MetroTrains to remove @skynewsaustralia from all CBD station screens. Hatred and racism have no place on our screens or in our community. #springst — Jacinta Allan (@JacintaAllanMP) August 8, 2018 
  
 Most didn’t have an issue with Knight criticising Allan — but they did think he went too far with his representation of African teens in the cartoon’s background. 
  
 “The racist vilification of Melburnians from the Herald Sun continues apace. Utterly shameful. STOP,” wrote Greens Melbourne City councillor Rohan Leppert on Twitter. 
  
 Others piled on:

 In his long editorial cartoonist career, Knight hasn’t been a stranger to controversy. Way back in 1999, he published this cartoon: 
  
 At the time, female politicians labelled the cartoon of senator Meg Lees (who was then leader of the Australian Democrats party) as sexist. 
  
 While Knight usually publishes his daily cartoons on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts, the Victoria train station cartoon was not on either account. ||||| CLOSE SportsPulse: Trysta Krick and Nancy Armour look at the complicated history between the tennis community and Serena Williams that help lead to the controversy at the US Open this past weekend and the subsequent racially insensitive cartoon depicting Williams.

 The artist behind a controversial and widely criticized cartoon of Serena Williams defended his depiction of Williams’ meltdown at the US Open and said it had nothing to do with race. 
  
 Mark Knight, a cartoonist for "The Herald Sun" in Australia, said in an interview Monday evening that his portrayal of Williams stomping on her racket as the chair umpire asked Naomi Osaka to let Williams win was an accurate representation of their final match. 
  
 “There’s nothing inaccurate in the cartoon, but I’m sorry it’s being taken by social media and distorted so much,” he said. 
  
 “The cartoon is about Serena, it was about her poor behavior. It had nothing to do with race.” 
  
 Author J.K. Rowling blasted the image as did numerous US media outlets.

 “People said I’m a racist because I drew Serena as an African American woman,” Knight explained. “I drew her as this powerful figure, which she is, she’s strongly built. They say I’m racist because I drew Naomi Osaka in the background with blonde hair. Well, she does have her hair dyed blonde.” 
  
 Knight said that his phone “melted down” as criticism of his portrait roiled social media all day. He also said his wife and children were subjected to threats on their Instagram pages as a result of the cartoon. 
  
 “This is how crazy it gets. It gets picked up by social media and it’s like a rolling thunder, a storm gathering intensity until it just turns into a tornado of false accusations and crazy things that aren’t even there.” 
  
 Knight defended his work and said there are previous examples of him portraying Williams in a more favorable light. 
  
 “I think these days, I don’t think you can, it’s called punching down,” he said. “You can’t punch down these days. And what that means is you can’t criticize minority groups for poor behavior. You just can’t go there. But I’m a cartoonist and I comment on all topics.” |||||
