A 46-year-old man from Billericay was found hurt at a house in Sudburys Farm Road, Little Burstead, on 30 July.
He was taken to a hospital in London but has since died, Essex Police said.
A 59-year-old man from Billericay and a 53-year-old man from Basildon who were arrested will remain on police bail until 4 September, the force added.
During a police appeal on Thursday, Det Insp Anne Cameron said there was a separate house fire on Blind Lane which was believed to be linked to the man being found hurt.
She appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
