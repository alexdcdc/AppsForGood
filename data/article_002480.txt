Ricky Hayden, 27, was attacked with his father Paul 54, as the pair tried to stop a moped being stolen from their home in Chadwell Heath in September.
Tommy Lee Roome, 19, of Rams Grove, Chadwell Heath, has been charged with murder and attempted murder and will face a trial in March.
Mr Hayden had worked at high-profile events and for ITV.
He worked as a security guard at Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy's wedding and was also a member of Havering Council's highways team.
His mother Suzanne Hayden described him as "kind, caring, honest, funny, cheeky".
She said: "What you see is what you get from Ricky, there's no hidden agendas. He's such a thoughtful person. He helps everyone. There's not a bad bone in his body.
"We don't go outside our home without somebody giving us some sort of support, a little hello, a little wave, blowing a kiss, messages we continually get.
"I woke up this morning and I had over 300 messages just to say hope the day goes as well as it can."
Paul Hayden said:  "(Knife crime) doesn't just kill the person, it kills the family and everyone around them and it hurts the whole neighbourhood because they're frightened of what's going to happen to them."

The 300-strong procession was led by a horse-drawn carriage from Mr Hayden's home. It passed a near-by chicken shop where Paul Hayden symbolically bought his son's "last meal".
The flowers mounted on top of the coffin spelled out "son", "uncle", "grandson" and "nephew" and were all orange - Ricky Hayden's favourite colour.
Mourners later released 100 orange balloons bearing hand-written messages.
Mr Hayden's mother, sister April, brother Perry and father embraced as the carriage pulled away.
Friends, family and neighbours, many of whom had contributed towards the funeral costs, laid flowers and paid their respects.
Mr Hayden was a hugely popular figure here and was known to many through his work as a nightclub security and with Havering Council.
