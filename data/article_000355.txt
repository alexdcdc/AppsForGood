The new trilogy is called The Book of Dust and the first novel will come out in October although the title of that book hasn't been released yet.
Phillip Pullman's first book in the His Dark Materials series was Northern Lights which came out in 1995.
The His Dark Materials trilogy sold more than 17.5 million copies and was translated into 40 languages.
The new series will once again be about the story of Lyra Belacqua and will begin when she is a baby and move on to when she is 20 years old later in the series.
