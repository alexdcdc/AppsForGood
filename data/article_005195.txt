Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 (Â£212,000) for a permit auctioned by the Dallas Safari Club, which said it would help fund future conservation.
Namibia is home to some 1,500 black rhino, a third of the world's total.
Mr Knowlton said his name had been posted on Facebook and threats had been made to harm both him and his children.
He said he had been speaking to the FBI about protecting his family. A number of people posted abuse on his Facebook page, calling him "cruel" and a "barbarian".
But he said those criticising him had failed to understand that the idea behind the hunt was to target an old, non-breeding male rhino that was endangering the rest of the herd.
"We're just not going in there and saying 'hey we're on a rhino hunt and, here, have a beer we're going to find a rhino,'" he told ABC TV affiliate WFAA in Dallas.
"No, it is a scientific process and we're going to make sure we get the ones that are causing the most problem."
Namibia issues three hunting permits per year, and this is the first time an auction has been held outside the southern African nation.
However, tens of thousands of people signed online petitions against the auction, and animal rights groups condemned as "perverse" claims that the hunt was really about conservation.
The money raised from the 11 January auction will go to the Namibian government and will be earmarked for conservation projects, according to the Dallas Safari Club.
"It takes money for these animals to exist. A lot of people don't recognise that," club executive Ben Carter told NPR radio.
Experts say that growing demand for rhino horn in Asia is driving up instances of poaching.
It is being fuelled by the belief in countries like China and Vietnam that powdered rhino horn has medicinal powers and can impact diseases like cancer. Horns can sell for around $65,000 a kilogram.
