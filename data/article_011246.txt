Aberdeen Journals is based in the Lang Stracht area of the city.
An announcement on the move is believed to be imminent.
The Â£107m Marischal Square development is due for completion in the summer of next year.
Neither Aberdeen Journals, developer Muse, or Aberdeen City Council have been willing to comment.
It is understood staff were told of the plans last week.
The proposed move is set be discussed in private by councillors at the authority's finance, policy and resources committee next week.
So far drinks and restaurant chain All Bar One and Marriott hotels have confirmed they intend to move into Marischal Square.
Protestors failed in their bid to get the development halted last March.
Councillors voted by 22-21 to continue with the project.
Aberdeen Journals is owned by Dundee-based DC Thomson.
The Press and Journal and Evening Express have not been printed in Aberdeen since 2013 when production moved to Dundee.
Until 1970 and the move to the Lang Stracht, Aberdeen Journals Ltd had offices in Broad Street, close to where Marischal Square is being built.
