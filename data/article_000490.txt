She was set upon by a "group of about 20 or 25 girls" when she went to the park.
She said: "They said, 'We didn't come here for no reason, we came to fight'."
"I was scared... but I think I'm getting better," she added.
The video of the brawl showed a girl being pushed to the ground and repeatedly kicked.
It was sent to her mother, Ilona Iloniuk, who posted it on social media.
The post said: "Today my daughter in Central Park got beaten up by a lot of girls. Maybe somebody knows who they are?
"I think that parents should look after their kids - she was only one and they were 20 on her."
Cambridgeshire Police said the brawl happened between 20:00 and 21:00 BST.
