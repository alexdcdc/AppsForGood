Springwatch's Kate Humble will co-host along with Ant Antstead, presenter on Channel 4's For the Love of Cars.
The show will go behind the scenes of the UK's car manufacturing industry to explain the science and engineering involved.
It will consist of two 90 minute live episodes and will air in the autumn.
The programmes will track in real time the transformation from raw materials to finished vehicle and will broadcast live from BMW's Mini plant in Oxford.
A press release from the BBC announcing the show included a quote from May saying: "I can't wait to build a car. Live."
There had been speculation over May's future on Top Gear after Jeremy Clarkson was dropped by the BBC in March following a "fracas" with a producer.
There had been reports May and fellow host Richard Hammond had been offered massive pay deals to stay with the show.
But with the announcement this week that Chris Evans will take over Clarkson's role, it was confirmed the two former presenters would not be returning for the new series.
May will be seen once more on Top Gear on Clarkson's final episode which will air on 28 June.
May and Hammond will present links from the studio and it will feature two films shot before Clarkson was dropped from the show.
Meanwhile Evans has announced open auditions to find replacements for May and Hammond.
