Defender Blackett, 22, moved to the Royals from Manchester United in August and has become a regular starter.
"I remember watching Jaap Stam from a young age," Blackett told BBC Radio Berkshire. "I grew up watching that treble-winning Manchester United team.
"I've seen the way he played and to work with him every day is great."
Blackett, who has predominantly played at left-back since his arrival, said ex-Manchester United and Netherlands defender Stam's attention to detail is keeping the squad focused in his first season in charge.
"There's lots of different things he helps me with every day in training," he continued.
"I try to implement them in training and in games as well, but he's the same with every player, be it a defender or an attacker."
Third-placed Reading head into a home match against Bristol City on Saturday on a run of four successive Championship wins, but Stam is still demanding more from his squad.
"We know as a team and as a club what we're collectively trying to achieve," Blackett added. "It's a process and a progression and we're trying to build on every performance in a bid to be better each time."
