A high tide helped the animals get back into deeper water.
Earlier, volunteers also managed to refloat around 100 of the more than 400 pilot whales which had beached on Thursday.
The stranding has been one of the worst ever seen in New Zealand and lots of volunteers turned up to help.
It is not clear why the pilot whales got stranded but experts say that when one becomes beached, it will send out distress signals which attracts other members of their pod, who then also get stranded.
