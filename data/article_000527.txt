Speaking to Sky News in Sleaford on Monday, Mr Farage could be seen standing in front of a UKIP poster with a letter 'n' in the word Hykeham.
Mr Farage was visiting the constituency in support of UKIP candidate Victoria Ayling.
The by-election takes place on Thursday.
Mr Farage seemed unaware of the error as he spoke about Brexit.
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason was one of those to highlight the error on social media.
One user, @HelenAnne73, tweeted: "Nice one @UKIP. Apparently I live in North Hykenham, not North Hykeham!!!"
Another, @richcrook85, said: "Where is North Hykenham? Is it near North Hykeham?"
The BBC contacted UKIP, but is yet to receive a response.
The Lincolnshire seat is vacant following the resignation of Conservative MP Stephen Phillips
Mr Phillips, who had held the seat since 2010, quit following what he described as "irreconcilable policy differences" with the government.
