Eight people were arrested on outstanding warrants, while 13 were reported for drugs offences and seven for anti-social behaviour.
One man was reported for possession of an offensive weapon.
Ch Insp Gary Ogilvie said: "We will continue to send a strong message that any criminality will not be tolerated.
"Along with local officers, specialist support teams from across Scotland are specifically tasked to tackle violence, disorder and anti-social behaviour in our communities. We will use every resource available to deal with offenders in order to keep people safe."
