The cup - won by Arsenal for the fourth time in its five-year history in 2015 - involves all 19 sides from Women's Super League One and Two.
The six lowest-ranked sides from 2015 were drawn into a preliminary round.
All eight of last season's WSL 1 sides move straight to the first round, and were deliberately drawn away from home.
Manchester City, the 2014 winners, are away to WSL 2 outfit Aston Villa in the first round, while Everton will host Liverpool in a Merseyside derby.
