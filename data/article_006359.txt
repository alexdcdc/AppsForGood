The Ducati rider, who won last week's Italy Grand Prix, was ahead of Repsol's Spanish pair Marc Marquez, in second, and Dani Pedrosa in third.
Britain's Cal Crutchlow was 11th.
The victory moves second-placed Dovizioso within seven points of Yamaha's Vinales, who finished 10th.
Reigning champion Marquez, who crashed four times in qualifying on Saturday as most of the field struggled with grip on a slippery circuit, celebrated his podium finish by falling on the rostrum.
"It was a strange weekend for everybody to manage the track, the grip, the  temperature, it was very difficult," said Dovizioso.
"It was a strange race, we couldn't push any lap because the rear tyre drops a lot, but I had the speed so I was able to manage and stay on the front without pushing."
Marquez's younger brother Alex won the Moto2 race, while another Spaniard Joan Mir took the honours in Moto3.
