Denbighshire council's scrutiny committee decided on Thursday the future provision of all adult services in the county will also go before full council.
The council runs care homes in Ruthin, Denbigh and Corwen, with 200 residents and 130 staff.
The authority needs to save Â£18m over the next two years.
