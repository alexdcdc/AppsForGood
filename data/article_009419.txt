The hosts, who sit fourth in League Two, had toppled Premiership side Hamilton Academical.
But McCluskey ensured there would be no such repeat, scoring from Denny Johnstone's cross before Joe McKee powered home before half-time.
McCluskey soon completed his treble, with Matt Flynn grabbing a consolation.
McCluskey opened the scoring with an emphatic finish following a deft Johnstone assist, the latter also setting-up McKee for Morton's second goal.
Rabin Omar pulled a chance wide for Annan early in the second period but Morton pulled further ahead when McCluskey added his second with a low finish after being teed-up by Bobby Barr.
McCluskey iced the cake two minutes later with a fine angled finish from inside the penalty area before Flynn headed home Smart Osadolor's cross with 14 minutes remaining.
