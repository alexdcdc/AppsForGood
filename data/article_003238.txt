The area from Castle Place to the new Ulster University campus on York Street will be enhanced as part of wider plans to rejuvenate the entire city centre.
The streetscape will get new paving, street furniture, lighting and public artwork.
The scheme is expected to cost £27m, with £20m coming from the Department for Communities (DfC).
Belfast City Council is also contributing £5m to the project.
The Belfast Streets Ahead Programme aims to regenerate the entire city centre in a number of phases, said Communities Minister Paul Givan.
"This latest phase will deliver a high-quality, sustainable, public realm scheme in the north of the city centre that will make a significant contribution to the wider regeneration works in the area," he added.
"These works will make the area more welcoming, vibrant and attractive to further investment and will build on the successful implementation of Belfast Streets Ahead in the heart of the shopping district which has helped transform the city centre."
The work is expected to start next spring and is due to be completed by mid-2019.
