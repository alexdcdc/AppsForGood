Officers found the body of Peter Stuart in Weybread, near Diss, on Friday night, after he and his wife Sylvia were reported missing.
Suffolk Police said a 61-year-old man from Leicester was arrested by officers at 08:30 BST.
Police are still searching for 69-year-old Mrs Stuart.
Officers said the arrested man was taken from Leicester to Suffolk to be interviewed by detectives.
Search teams will continue their work in the vicinity of the couple's home at Mill Lane, and police said officers were also continuing their inquiries to determine exactly what occurred.
A post-mortem examination of the body, believed to be that of Mr Stuart, was due to be held on Sunday.
Det Ch Supt Simon Parkes said: "While we have made an arrest, our investigation continues.
"We are absolutely committed to finding Sylvia and this remains a priority for us. We would ask anyone who may have information that may help to come forward."
The Reverend Susan Loxton, rector of St Andrew in Weybread, held a special service at the church on Sunday morning.
"Prayers were said in the church for the family of the couple, for friends and neighbours, and for the police," she said.
"In these rural villages there is little crime so when something like this happens there is shock. We did not think something like this happens here."
Det Ch Supt Parkes said: "We are still exploring the possibilities. We hope to find Mrs Stuart alive, but we can't dismiss the possibility we will find her dead. The post mortem [of Mr Stuart's body] is ongoing."
