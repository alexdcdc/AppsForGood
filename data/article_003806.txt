The Isle of Wight officer was "left shaken" after the prisoner attacked him on the way back to his cell at HMP Isle of Wight, on Saturday.
The incident left the officer with "superficial" cuts to his throat, the prison said.
A 24-year-old inmate was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
He has been bailed until February.
Neil Yule, chairman of the Prison Officer's Association at HMP Isle of Wight's Albany branch, said the inmate had hidden a razor blade in his mouth after receiving medical treatment, which he then used to attack one of the officers.
"Thankfully the wounds are superficial, however the attempt was certainly to cause major damage. It was a very nasty incident," he said.
Mr Yule added that, although the injured officer's wounds would heal, mentally he remained "very shaken".
He said: "I think it could have been an awful lot worse and the prison officer has had an exceptionally lucky escape."
The inmate was sent to Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight.
A prison service spokesman said: "We do not tolerate violence against our hard-working and dedicated staff, and when incidents like this occur, we work closely with the police to push for the strongest possible punishment."
The prison in Newport is a category B prison.
HMP Isle of Wight was created in 2009 with the merger of Parkhurst, Albany and Camp Hill prisons, the latter facility closed in 2013.
