The victory for the Brown Panther, trained by Tom Dascombe, was the 11th of the horse's career.
It follows previous triumphs in the Goodwood Cup in 2013 and last year in the Irish St Leger.
Meanwhile Prince Bishop beat favourite California Chrome in the Dubai World Cup, the world's richest horse race.
Former England international footballer Owen said Brown Panther had been "a superstar from day one and this man [Dascombe] has trained him to perfection".
"He always jumps really well out of the traps and he found himself right up there.
"The rest is history, as they say. He's a special horse. I'll probably never replace a horse like this," said Owen.
It is hard to argue with Dascombe's assertion that the horse is now probably better than ever.
Jockey Richard Kingscote deserves particular mention having bravely fought back - only returning recently - from very serious injury incurred in a bone-crunching fall at Wolverhampton in November.
The Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, which is more than half a mile further, has inevitably been mentioned as a likely target, although last summer, when fourth, Brown Panther's stamina appeared to run out.
In the Dubai World Cup, William Buick rode 14-1 shot Prince Bishop to victory for Godolphin trainer Saeed bin Suroor, his seventh World Cup winner.
The race has a purse worth $10m dollars (£6.7m) with more than £3.8m going to the winner.
