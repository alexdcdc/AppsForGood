Extensive work on the Theatre Royal in Dumfries was originally priced at about £1.9m.
Dumfries and Galloway Council was told that "unforeseen structural issues" had pushed spending up to £2.11m.
Councillors have now agreed to award an extra £50,000 to the project in addition to £455,000 it agreed to provide in May 2013.
The appeal for the additional contribution came from the Master of the Guild of Players of Dumfries - the group which has been the driving force behind the renovation.
In a report, councillors were told that the interior walls and ceilings of the original auditorium deteriorated rapidly as the building began to dry out.
That significantly increased mechanical and engineering costs.
There was also an increase in water connection and disconnection charges.
