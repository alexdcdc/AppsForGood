It's not exactly upheaval, but there are rumblings at The Huffington Post. Now that HuffPo bloggers know how much the liberal's Drudge Report is worth—$315 M.—and how much cash their boss Arianna Huffington made off its sale to AOL—~$100 M. (Disclaimer: Blodget estimate)—they think it's time for a "nominal pay structure," according to The Daily. The iPad newspaper wrangled this tender quotation from a HuffPo contributor from Tel Aviv: 
  
 When it was just the HuffPo, I was happy to contribute for free because it felt like this really great, new, fresh project, like I was a part of something important. Going corporate diminishes that spirit a little bit. And I'm also aware that, as I've managed to develop a name for myself, I might be bringing business to AOL that they might not have had otherwise. I'm honestly not 100 percent sure how I feel about doing that for free for a corporate giant. 
  
 We doubt they're holding their breath. In a memo to bloggers Huffington said that "that's the only real change you'll notice—more people reading what you wrote." They'll be more influential than ever.
