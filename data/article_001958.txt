Gary Ferguson, 47, was found with chest and head injuries at the apartment of fellow English teacher Harris Binotti in Yangon earlier this month.
Local police said Mr Binotti, 25, took a flight to Thailand the day before Mr Ferguson's body was found.
His brother, Martin Ferguson, appealed for help to get "justice" for Gary.
In a statement, he said: "Our goal is to get Interpol into the investigation.
"What measures have been taken by the Myanmar police to stop [Harris Binotti] from travelling abroad? Has his passport been blocked and put in a database?
"As information from the Foreign Office has been little we would hope that press coverage could get us the justice that Gary deserves."
He said the family felt they had been "robbed of a dear brother and father who had so much to offer this world".
Mr Ferguson was the father of a four-year-old boy.
He and Mr Binotti are believed to have gone out drinking two nights before his body was discovered and neighbours reported hearing sounds of a fight.
Both men were teachers at the Horizon International School in Yangon, in the south of the country formerly known as Burma.
Mr Ferguson had worked there for a year and Mr Binotti, who is thought to have connections to Dumfries and Aberdeen, for three months.
Mr Ferguson said Gary had travelled the world extensively and "loved to teach and educate people from all places in life".
"From Zimbabwe, India, Tibet, Korea and Australia, China and Thailand, particularly Asia he adored, the Thai islands, meeting with friends and enjoying music.
"His friends are shocked and in disbelief. So many kind messages from all over the world to say how unbelievable this is for them."
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "We are continuing to help and support the family of Mr Ferguson at this difficult time and are in contact with the Burmese authorities."
