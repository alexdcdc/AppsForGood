Andrew Virco, 50, and Katharine Walker, 51, from Cambridge, died with two other Britons when the aircraft crashed into a glacier on South Island, on Saturday.
Ms Walker's daughter, Rebecca, 22, said the couple were on a "big adventure" that had been planned for some time.
"They do holidays but this was the big one... they had waited for," she said.
"New Zealand was her dream. Her and Andy had been planning it for a long time. It was what they would do for their 50th birthdays.
"It was their celebration together."
Ms Walker was head of radiotherapy at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Her daughter, a university student, said: "She was everything. She had a special spin on life. She worked hard and she played hard. That's the way she lived her life.
"She affected so many people in so many good ways. The things she did at work were incredible.
"You just walked through town and everybody would be like 'hi, hi'. I couldn't go shopping without her seeing someone she knew. Cambridge is a big place but she affected so many people.
"Not having her here is just going to break so many people. It hasn't sunk in yet."
She described Mr Virco, an award-winning photographer, as "amazing".
"He took me into his world," she said. "He treated me like his daughter and you can't say much more than that. He's going to be missed."
Nigel and Helen Charlton, aged 66 and 70, from Hampshire, also died in the crash, along with Sovannmony Leang, 27, and Josephine Gibson, 29, both from New South Wales, Australia; and pilot Mitchell Gameren, 28, from Queenstown, New Zealand.
The recovery operation has been halted for the day after weather conditions at Fox Glacier deteriorated. Three bodies have been recovered.
The cause of the crash is being investigated.
