FASA (Forum for Action on Substance Abuse) has said it is facing "the prospect of immediate and terminal financial insolvency".
It provides specialised support to people facing issues such as suicide, self harm and substance misuse.
The group is seeking an urgent meeting with Stormont ministers and funders.
"It is with overwhelming sadness that we announce that FASA is facing the prospect of immediate and terminal financial insolvency," FASA said in a statement.
"As a result all services have been suspended.
"We are deeply committed to the vital services which FASA provides to needy and vulnerable individuals and we are seeking urgent meetings with funders and with political representatives at the highest level to avert this crisis and to enable the continuation of these essential support services."
In a statement on Wednesday evening, the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland said it is investigating "concerns" in relation to FASA and added that the "charity is co-operating with the Commission's investigation".
