The Department for Regional Development (DRD) says the project has now been pushed back to August 2018.
Mr Dallat said: "This is yet another setback in the pursuit of a modern transport system fit for purpose.
"On this occasion we do not have a minister to answer questions or explain what has led to another delay.
"This announcement, coming amid yet another political crisis, suits those responsible for the mess, but who have been left virtually unaccountable by the impending collapse of the executive.
"The minister would be serving this community better if he was present to explain this latest cop-out in a departmental project managed entirely by civil servants," he added.
DRD secretary Peter May said he recognised this was "going to be a disappointment" but said he wished to stress the delay did not relate to the "current political difficulties" or the resignation of the regional development minister.
"Severe budget pressures remain on the department and there is still uncertainty about the position for future years," he said.
"Continued uncertainty has meant that the programme has not been able to commit resources in the original time frame."
Mr Dallat said that in this instance, Translink was not to blame because "this is a project where the total responsibility lies with the DRD".
"They have failed and must now come before the committee to explain the reason for this delay," he said.
"The rapid transport system is a poor substitute for a proper dedicated cross-city rail system but at the least it was a beginning, now we need to know when the beginning will be."
The rapid transport system was originally due to begin operating by autumn 2017.
