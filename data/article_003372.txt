Lisa Anthony, 47, and 14-year-old Ava Anthony were found at their house in a gated community in Esher on Monday.
Mrs Anthony died of a compression to the neck, a post-mortem examination found. Further tests will be carried out to find out how Ava died.
Fiona Boulton, Ava's head teacher, said she had a "wonderful smile".
Concerns had been raised after the mother and daughter had not been seen for nearly two weeks.
Jonathan Anthony, thought to be husband and father of the pair, was found dead on Sunday in southern France.
Ms Boulton, the head teacher at Guildford High School, said: "Everybody here is shocked and deeply saddened by this horrific news.
"Ava was a wonderful, charming girl who was a genuine pleasure to know and to teach. She had a love of life that enriched everyone around her and a wonderful smile that could fill a room."
She said her pupil was especially talented in drama and the performing arts.
"She was a warm and generous girl who was popular, fun and a delight to be with."
The last confirmed sighting of the mother and daughter had been on 17 June, Surrey Police said.
The case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because it emerged someone who knew Mrs Anthony called Surrey Police on 24 June over concerns for her welfare.
The case has now been referred back to Surrey Police to investigate.
A post-mortem examination examination on Mr Anthony's body will be carried out in France, a spokesman for Surrey Police said.
