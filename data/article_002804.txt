The winger scored two of Scotland's six tries as they trounced Italy 48-7 in their penultimate World Cup warm-up match at Murrayfield.
"Everybody played well today, that's the difference," he told BBC Scotland.
"When the whole team plays well we're brilliant. But when one, either the front or backs, fails to function then we make it difficult for ourselves."
Scotland play France in Paris next week in their final warm-up before their opening game at the World Cup against Japan in just over three weeks and Lamont, who earned his 96th cap in the win over Italy, feels positive about Scotland's chances.
"Providing we do everything every week and nail our roles then I don't think there is a limit," he added. "And I'll stand by that.
"We've got an exciting team. Our fitness showed today. That's a good base. You want your fitness to be as good as you can.
"You can be the most skilful player in the world but if your fitness starts to drop then your skill level drops. Look, we're happy. It's not the World Cup won yet. It's just merely one step."
Vern Cotter names his final squad of 31 players on Tuesday and despite playing all three of Scotland's warm-up matches so far the 34-year-old does not want to take his place for granted.
"That's where complacency comes in," Lamont continued. "I've done as much as I can. It's what is right for Scotland. That's all I care about.
"If I'm there, I'm there. If I'm not, then the guys who get their chance have got to take it. I've done all I can."
