The three-bedroom suburban cul-de-sac house featured as 4 Privet Drive, Surrey, home of the boy wizard's dreadful aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.
But it is, in fact, 12 Picket Post Close in Bracknell, Berkshire.
Its current owners have put the house on sale for Â£475,000 - it was bought for Â£290,000 in 2010.

The original owners were first approached by Warner Brothers in 2000 to use the building in their movie.
Filming took place at the location over two weeks as the property was transformed into the home of the Dursley family.
A cupboard under the stairs, similar to the one where Harry is famously forced to live by his relatives, also features in the house.
Estate agent Paul Bosanko, said the property had already received global interest and had set new records in the number of "clicks" received on its website.
"When we first launched the property four days ago, we did not mention the Harry Potter connection, but this morning it's been pretty evident that the world is interested in this property and there is an awful lot of hype", he added.
