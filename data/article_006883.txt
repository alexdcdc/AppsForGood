The evocative images are being exhibited at the Bluecoat Arts Centre as part of the Look/15 international photography festival.
Tricia Porter's photographs of life in the L8 district of the city show a time when its tight-knit communities were being fragmented.
She said the project was an attempt to make a photo documentary.
The pictures were taken a decade before the area became nationally known following the Toxteth Riots in 1981.
The project was a joint venture between Tricia Porter and her future husband David, then a student at Liverpool University.
The pair lived in the area and photographed the people they came across.
They gained the trust of residents who allowed them access to their lives, businesses and homes.
The project is divided into two series: Bedford Street, Liverpool 8 (1972) and Some Liverpool Kids (1974).
The first focuses on residents in their homes, at work, or out and about in the area.
Bedford Street, Liverpool 8 (1972) includes well-known characters including social campaigner and local councillor Margaret Simey and eminent Liverpool sculptor Herbert Tyson Smith at work in his studio at Bluecoat.
Young people predominate Some Liverpool Kids (1974) in their homes, schools, clubs, shops and streets.
Ms Porter said: "It was an attempt to make a photo-documentary which would be a positive and meaningful statement about my neighbours, who had all too often been treated as statistical fodder and sociological phenomena."
The Bluecoat's Artistic Director Bryan Biggs said: "Tricia's images have an immediacy and freshness, despite being taken over four decades ago and the places they evoke having changed, in some cases beyond all recognition.
"There is an honesty to them that makes them so compelling and resonant today."
The exhibition runs between 4 April and 5 July and is supported by L8 Legacy Projects.
