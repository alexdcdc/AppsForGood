More than 170 fallen trees and branches were reported to Devon County Council over the weekend.
Seven flood warnings are in force on rivers across Devon.
Huge waves made Torquay's Living Coasts wildlife park unsafe for visitors and Dartmoor Zoological Park is closed because of strong winds, the tourist attraction said.
Incidents of flooding have been reported in Kingskerswell, Brixham, Paignton and Barnstaple.
The Environment Agency said the Lower Teign had burst its banks between Chudleigh and Kingsteignton.
It added that it was not aware of any properties that had been flooded.
The River Otter, Yarty, Culm, Batherm, Clyst, Lower Torridge and Lower Teign are on flood alert, the agency said.
Farmer Nigel Mail, from Taddiport, said: It's [the River Torridge] at least five feet higher than it should be.
"Logs are going by, debris, you name it, it's going down the river. There are logs going down that are 3-4ft wide... the weather is unbelievable," he added.
In Somerset,  
          flood alerts for every river
 have been issued after heavy rainfall.
At Dartmoor Zoological Park, the wind brought down a large tree in an enclosure which is home to a capybara - a large South American rodent.
A spokesman said: "None of the enclosures have been damaged by falling trees. All the animals are tucked away and there are no dangerous trees on site."
Living Coasts director Elaine Hayes said: "Right now it is not safe for visitors to come to Living Coasts as waves are washing over the terrace. All the animals are safe."
Both attractions said they hoped to open on Tuesday.
