Natalie Putt left her home in Thornleigh, Lower Gornal, on 1 September 2003, leaving her 11-week-old son in the house with relatives.
It was the last time anyone reported seeing the 17-year-old.
West Midlands Police said it was investigating after a man in France called them with information.
Det Sgt Matt Morgan said he received the call after the force made the renewed appeal on Monday.
He said: "I had a gentleman from France contact me, having heard this information, passing on some third-hand intelligence which may or may not be of some use to us and that's something I'll be following up.
"Any credible intelligence that's passed to us will be acted upon."
An 18-year-old man was arrested in 2004 in connection with Natalie's disappearance but was later released without charge.
Police searched land in Wombourne, south Staffordshire, earlier this year after a tip-off but said the investigation remained a missing person inquiry.
Natalie's father David Putt said: "I don't want to fear the worst but 10 years is a long, long time and obviously the longer it goes the more reality sinks in that she may never return.
"Every little bit of information helps and I hope that can lead us to find what has happened to her."
