President Trump is expected to announce that Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci will be White House communications director, according to two sources familiar with the planning. 
  
 Trump has left the role open since Mike Dubke resigned in May, and the President has vented frequently to his friends about the performance of his press operation. 
  
 Trump's plans to appoint Scaramucci came as a surprise to Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who found out after the plans had already been made. ||||| We've detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser. Would you like to proceed to legacy Twitter?

 The Trump administration is expected to name former Trump transition team official Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director, four sources in and close to the White House told NBC News Thursday. 
  
 The news of the expected appointment was first reported by Axios. A White House official said the move is expected to be announced Friday. Scaramucci did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
  
 A different White House official described Scaramucci to NBC News as a "total professional" with the respect of President Donald Trump. Scaramucci was a supporter of Trump's during the campaign, dealing with fundraising and appearing on cable TV as a frequent defender of the president.

 Prior to throwing his support behind Trump, Scaramucci was a Scott Walker and then a Jeb Bush booster. 
  
 Scaramucci met with Trump and his daughter Ivanka in the Oval Office on Thursday where Trump offered him the job, a source with knowledge of the situation said. The source said Trump has known Scaramucci for years and likes him. 
  
 "Comms is what Anthony does,” the source said. “It's how he built his business. The guy knows media. He's been a good advocate for the president." 
  
 White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has technically been doing double duty as press secretary and communications director since the departure of communications director Mike Dubke, who resigned in May after just three months on the job. Spicer has not responded to a request for comment. 
  
 Another source said Spicer is definitely staying on. The position was open so this is being seen as a bolstering of the staff, not a demotion for Spicer. ||||| Anthony Scaramucci is finally heading to Washington. 
  
 The Long Island-born financier and loyalist to President Donald Trump was appointed chief strategy officer of the Export-Import Bank last week — roughly five months after his first promised White House gig failed to materialize. 
  
 “Mr. Scaramucci’s main role is to assess how the Export-Import Bank can better capitalize upon opportunities to support American jobs by financing American exports,” a spokesperson for the bank said Tuesday. 
  
 It is Scaramucci’s third attempt to land a gig with the Trump administration. In January, Scaramucci, known in the hedge-fund crowd as “The Mooch,” was said to have landed a role with the White House Office of Public Engagement, but the role disappeared after he sold his company, SkyBridge Capital, to foreign buyers. 
  
 Earlier this month, it was reported that Scaramucci was up for the role of ambassador to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The job, which needs Senate approval and a move to Paris, may still be in play. 
  
 Scaramucci’s new role with the Ex-Im Bank, which was first reported by Politico, is not without irony. 
  
 While campaigning, Trump called the bank “excess baggage.” 
  
 But the president changed his tune in April, telling the Wall Street Journal that the bank is “a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.” 
  
 The bank, which has been called “corporate welfare” by other Republican critics, provides financing for US exports when other, more traditional lenders may be unwilling to assume the risk. |||||
