The six-time Olympic champion returns to the track where he won triple gold at the 2012 London Olympics to take part in the event from 22-23 July.
London, which is part of the IAAF Diamond League Series, will host Bolt's final race before Rio 2016.
The 29-year-old retained his 100m, 200m and 4x100m titles at the Beijing World Championships in 2015.
