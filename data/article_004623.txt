The driver is believed to have lost control as he drove at high speed along a ring road leading to Hurghada's airport, the Mena news agency reported.
The crash also injured 27 Hungarian tourists, including four children.
Poor road conditions and lax enforcement of traffic laws are blamed for a high accident rate in Egypt.
The bus was carrying the tourists from their hotel to the airport when the accident happened, officials said.
Hurghada is located on the Red Sea coast, about 500km (300 miles) southeast of Cairo.
The accident took place on the first day of Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, when many Egyptians and tourists head to Red Sea resorts.
Police estimate road accidents kill about 6,000 people annually in the nation with a population of about 82 million.
Eight US tourists were killed in a bus crash last December near the southern city of Aswan.
