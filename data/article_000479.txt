Kenneth Harper, 33, was convicted of the sex crimes last year, along with further charges of assault and reckless behaviour, after a high court trial.
Judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh quashed his convictions for the two rape charges after defence arguments about mutual corroboration.
He was given a three-year sentence for the remaining offences.
Solicitor advocate John Keenan challenged the rape convictions, which were based on mutual corroboration.
That meant the evidence of one allegation was being used to support the other.
Mr Keenan said there were only two alleged offences and there was a substantial time gap between them of almost eight years.
He said the circumstances in which they were said to have occurred were different and there was an absence of "extraordinary features".
He argued that there must be something compelling to link events separated by many years, but here there was nothing.
The Crown claimed that there were compelling similarities as both offences involved vulnerable women who were significantly younger than Harper, the first was aged 15 and the second 22.
It also argued that evidence from a third woman, who was assaulted, could be used to support the convictions.
Lord Brodie, who heard the appeal with Lord Bracadale and Lady Cosgrove, said: "Long lapse of time does not preclude the finding of sufficient similarity between two incidents to infer a course of conduct, but it is relevant.
"Where the interval is a long one it is necessary to consider whether there are any extraordinary features in the evidence that nonetheless make the similarities compelling.
"The time interval, at a little short of eight years, was long. Accordingly for the Crown to be able to link the two alleged incidents it must be able to identify some special feature. There was no such feature in the present case."
Harper had originally been jailed at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted in Aberdeen.
