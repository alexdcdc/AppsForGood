Stormont Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said it was the first major shake-up in the law since the alcohol limit was introduced in 1968.
Under the plans, the permitted blood alcohol limit would be reduced to 50mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - down from the current UK limit of 80mg.
It is thought the bill could become law by early next year.
The legislation also proposes changes for driver training and testing:
Mr Durkan said Northern Ireland's drink-drive laws would be brought into line with Europe, including the Republic of Ireland.
"Radical measures are necessary if we are to pursue an ambition of zero road deaths," he said.
"This new legislation will tackle drivers who shamelessly continue to drink and drive.
"It will provide powers to radically overhaul how we train, test and protect our vulnerable new drivers.
"It will also reduce the risk to riders of quads on public roads by requiring them to wear helmets."
The chairman of the Driving Instructors Association in Northern Ireland said the lowering of the minimum age for learner drivers "has been sprung on us".
"It wasn't in the consultation paper that we responded to, and we are told it was a ministerial decision," said Tom Burns.
"We are going to be completely out of kilter with the mainland, who are talking about raising the age to 18 - it doesn't seem to have been thought out.
"Also, the one-year minimum period for learning is too long for many people, and it doesn't suit people like pregnant women for example, who have to get their test as soon as possible."
The legislation proposes a number of other measures on drink-driving:
