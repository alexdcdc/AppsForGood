 The Marlins reportedly are shopping J.T. Realmuto, who is arguably MLB's best catcher at a time when productive all-around backstops are in short supply. 
  
 Below you will find a list of the latest news and rumors surrounding Realmuto. 
  
 Realmuto talks heating up, multiple teams in play 
  
 Jan. 26: There are a lot of teams in the hunt for Realmuto, and trade talks are "heating up," according to a report from MLB.com Marlins beat writer Joe Frisaro on Saturday. 
  
 Frisaro tweets that the Padres, Dodgers, Braves, Astros, Reds and Rays are all still in play for Miami's All-Star catcher -- and it's hard to pick a favorite. 
  
 Tweet from @JoeFrisaro: Latest on J.T. Realmuto. #Marlins talks heating up with multiple teams still in play. #Padres #Dodgers #Braves #Astros #Reds #Rays Also, interested clubs not getting a window to negotiate long-term deal with J.T. Hard to handicap who has inside edge. 
  
 That's a varied slate of interested teams, but they all have good reason to want Realmuto. The Dodgers, Braves, Astros and Rays are all catcher-needy contenders, while the Padres and Reds are looking for players like Realmuto to build around. 
  
 One complicating factor, per Frisaro, is that those interested teams aren't getting a window to try to negotiate a long-term extension with the 27-year-old Realmuto, who is under team control for two more seasons until he hits free agency in 2021. 
  
 Padres reportedly targeting Realmuto 
  
 Jan. 25: As the Padres wait for their talent-rich farm system to bear fruit, the club is reportedly exploring a couple of big-name additions that could significantly expedite its rebuilding process. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, San Diego is pursuing free-agent infielder Manny Machado while also discussing a trade for Realmuto. 
  
 The Realmuto saga has dragged on for months, reportedly due to the Marlins' lofty asking price. The Padres have elite prospects to spare, though, and could be a particularly good trade partner for Miami because they can offer a young catcher -- either Austin Hedges or Francisco Mejia -- as part of the return package.

 After landing Pollock, are Dodgers targeting Realmuto? 
  
 Jan. 24: Just when it looked like the Dodgers were out on dealing for J.T. Realmuto, they put themselves right back in the mix. 
  
 Los Angeles has agreed to a multi-year deal with center fielder A.J. Pollock, according to multiple reports. That likely takes them out of the picture for fellow outfielder Bryce Harper, who had been thought of as a possible replacement since the Dodgers traded away Yasiel Puig and Matt Kemp a month ago.

 The Dodgers' focus now appears to have shifted to trading for Realmuto, the Marlins' All-Star backstop, as MLB Network insider Jon Heyman and USA Today's Bob Nightengale both report. 
  
 Tweet from @JonHeyman: dodgers are also working on jt realmuto. they've been talking to the marlins as the real players for the star catcher are coming into focus. 
  
 Tweet from @BNightengale: The #Dodgers now focusing on #Marlins catcher JT Realmuto, with intensive on-going talks. 
  
 Along with Pollock, Realmuto would give L.A. another right-handed hitter with pop -- a specific need the club's front office has been targeting in the wake of moving Puig and Kemp, as MLB Network insider Joel Sherman notes. 
  
 Tweet from @Joelsherman1: 2/So they waited until Pollock price fell to more favorable range and are sitting and waiting on same with trade ask on Realmuto. If they come out with both they would have added RH bats/impact without blowing out future payrolls while remaining NL West team to beat 
  
 After longtime Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal inked a one-year contract with the Brewers earlier this month, Los Angeles acquired Russell Martin from Toronto to shore up the position. That appeared to take the Dodgers out of the mix for Realmuto, who has been the biggest and longest-standing name on the trade-rumors front this offseason. But the two sides have remained in talks, according to MLB.com's Joe Frisaro, with a high-end prospect in Keibert Ruiz being discussed as a potential return. 
  
 "A few weeks ago, it appeared that the Dodgers had moved in another direction, especially after acquiring veteran catcher Russell Martin from the Blue Jays on Jan. 11," Frisaro wrote recently. "But sources said that Los Angeles indeed is still interested in Realmuto, and Ruiz is a possibility to be part of a deal with Miami." 
  
 Ruiz was named the No. 3 catching prospect overall by MLB Pipeline last week, meaning he would be a good get for Miami as a replacement for Realmuto down the line. The switch-hitter batted .268/.328/.401 with 12 homers and a 33-to-26 strikeout-to-walk ratio in Double-A in 2018 -- all the more impressive considering it was his age-19 season. 
  
 Aside from the fact that Realmuto is under control through 2020, part of the reason the Marlins have been hesitant to move him is because the organization lacks depth at the position. That also explains why Miami could be showing interest in Ruiz. 
  
 Aside from the Dodgers, the Rays, Padres, Astros, Braves and Reds also have been reported as suitors for Realmuto, who comes with a lofty asking price that starts with a top prospect or a young, impact big leaguer with several years of control.

 Are markets for Harper and Machado impacting Realmuto's future? 
  
 Jan. 19: J.T. Realmuto has been the player talked about most on this offseason's trade market, but he still remains a Marlin for the time being. That could change soon, according to MLB.com's Joe Frisaro, who said on MLB Network that he believes a deal will come together prior to Spring Training. Still, the current "holding pattern" in Realmuto's case, Frisaro said, may be due to the fact that neither of the two marquee free agents on the market, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, have signed yet. 
  
 "Let's say Machado or Harper signs with the Phillies," said Frisaro. "Does that motivate the Braves to say, 'Now we've got to make our counter-move,' and they add an extra piece to get a deal done with the Marlins? I think there's a little bit of that going on, but as far as I can tell you from the reporting I've done, and others have agreed, there are about four or five teams in. I think the Braves are one of those teams that are just waiting in the wings."

 Realmuto, 27, had a breakout year in 2018, slashing .277/.340/.484 with 21 home runs in 125 games for Miami. He has well-above-average speed and is considered one of the best catchers in the game today. MLB Network ranks him as the No. 2 catcher in baseball right now. More > 
  
 How does Dodgers' trade for Martin affect Realmuto market? 
  
 Jan. 11: The Dodgers have been linked to Marlins catcher J.T. Realmuto perhaps more than any other team this offseason, but the club now seemingly has its catching situation shored up for 2019. Los Angeles has acquired Russell Martin from Toronto, reuniting the team with a player it initially selected in the 2002 Draft. 
  
 Martin will help to fill the void left by Yasmani Grandal, who agreed to a one-year deal with the Brewers on Wednesday after rejecting the Dodgers' qualifying offer. The 35-year-old figures to split time with Austin Barnes, keeping the position warm for catching prospects Keibert Ruiz and Will Smith. 
  
 Martin played with the Dodgers from 2006-10 and produced a .761 OPS in that span while winning one Gold Glove Award. He has one year and $20 million remaining on the five-year, $82 million deal he signed with the Blue Jays in November 2014, and Toronto will reportedly be picking up a significant portion of that money. 
  
 Tweet from @Ken_Rosenthal: #Dodgers getting cash to cover significant portion of Martin���s $20M salary in 2019 and parting with two minor leaguers. https://t.co/meG6Ay6ORF 
  
 The Dodgers' trade for Martin comes one day after MLB.com's Joe Frisaro reported that Los Angeles was among six teams "engaged in substantive discussions" with the Marlins about a deal for Realmuto, who is under control for two more seasons. The Braves, Astros, Padres, Rays and Reds were the other five, according to a source. 
  
 Los Angeles' decision to add Martin is perhaps further proof that Miami's asking price for Realmuto is prohibitive. The Marlins have been shopping Realmuto for months, but talks continue to stall. 
  
 Of course, it's possible the Dodgers will continue to discuss Realmuto with the Marlins while viewing Martin as a fallback option if a deal doesn't come together. Los Angeles could also add Martin or Barnes to its offer for Realmuto, as Miami will need a replacement backstop if it trades its starting catcher. 
  
 Mattingly: Realmuto could remain with Marlins entering Spring Training 
  
 Jan. 4: More than two months after the offseason began, the J.T. Realmuto situation is seemingly no closer to being resolved. 
  
 "As one rival executive put it, the fact that Realmuto is still a Marlin tells you everything you need to know about the team's asking price for their All-Star catcher," MLB Network insider Ken Rosenthal wrote in a column for The Athletic (subscription required) on Thursday. 
  
 Indeed, the Marlins' asking price for Realmuto -- essentially, either a top-tier prospect or a promising young big leaguer with years of control, plus other pieces -- remains as high as ever, MLB.com's Joe Frisaro reported Wednesday. "Until something gives, either with the Marlins lowering their demands or a team shows it's willing to part with a top prospect and more," Frisaro wrote, "the Realmuto saga essentially is a standoff." 
  
 "For me, I'm ecstatic right now, because I feel like we're walking into camp with J.T. again," Marlins manager Don Mattingly said Friday on MLB Network's Hot Stove. "He's the real deal. That's why, I think, we've put a price tag on him that's way up there." 
  
 That said, interested teams are maintaining the belief that the Marlins will ultimately deal the backstop before the season begins, per Rosenthal, because "keeping him would border on front-office malpractice." 
  
 As Rosenthal points out, Realmuto's trade value is unlikely to increase during the upcoming season, for multiple reasons. There will be fewer teams looking for a catcher come July, and those that still do need one will likely be even more reluctant to trade Major League pieces at that point. Furthermore, teams are mindful that a newly acquired catcher will need to learn about the club's pitching staff on the fly, which is a difficult endeavor -- even for the best defensive backstops. 
  
 The Dodgers, Astros, Padres, Rays and Reds are believed to be the clubs most interested in the All-Star backstop. Will one of them decide to part with the young talent Miami covets? Or will the suitors continue to wait out the Marlins to see if they really do hold onto Realmuto -- who is controllable through the 2020 season -- heading into Spring Training and beyond? For now, this game of chicken continues ...

 Will Astros meet asking price for Realmuto? 
  
 Jan. 1: The buzz surrounding J.T. Realmuto has quieted down since the Winter Meetings, as teams have been unwilling to meet the Marlins' lofty asking price for their All-Star catcher. 
  
 The Astros remain interested in the backstop, according to MLB.com's Jon Paul Morosi, but Miami has not moved off its demand for either Kyle Tucker or Forrest Whitley to be the centerpiece of a trade. Thus, trade talks between the two clubs haven't gained traction. 
  
 Tweet from @jonmorosi: Source: #Astros still interested in J.T. Realmuto, but #Marlins have yet to move off Forrest Whitley or Kyle Tucker as the centerpiece of a possible trade. Thus, there���s been no traction in trade discussions. @MLBNetwork @MLB 
  
 Tucker and Whitley are two of the top prospects in baseball, ranking fifth and eighth, respectively, on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 list. Houston has two other prospects on the list -- outfielder Yordan Alvarez (No. 42 overall) and right-hander Josh James (No. 95 overall) -- but it makes sense for Miami to insist that either Tucker or Whitley be in the deal. After all, Realmuto is arguably the top player at MLB's shallowest position, and he is two years away from free agency. 
  
 As part of his 19 bold predictions for 2019, MLB.com's Anthony Castrovince provides his take on where Realmuto will wind up. "The Astros will trade for Realmuto," Castrovince writes. "And Kyle Tucker? Despite the reports about the Astros balking at the Marlins' current asking price, you're going to look good in Miami blue and caliente red, bud." 
  
 The Marlins don't have a single player on the Top 100 list, despite trading Christian Yelich, Marcell Ozuna, Giancarlo Stanton and Dee Gordon last offseason, and Lewis Brinson -- the centerpiece of the Yelich deal -- is coming off a season in which he recorded a 56 wRC+ in 406 plate appearances. Realmuto is Miami's best remaining asset, and the club desperately needs to hit a home run when it finally trades him. 
  
 The Astros' reluctance to include Tucker or Whitley isn't that surprising, either, and not just because the two are so highly touted. Houston's roster, which includes Max Stassi and newcomer Robinson Chirinos behind the plate, is good enough to win the World Series without Realmuto. 
  
 Padres remain engaged on Realmuto 
  
 Dec. 27: Corey Kluber apparently isn't the only big name the Padres are currently targeting in a trade, as MLB.com's Jon Paul Morosi reports that San Diego has continued to have discussions regarding Marlins catcher J.T. Realmuto. 
  
 Tweet from @jonmorosi: Sources: #Padres have continued talks with #Marlins on possible J.T. Realmuto trade. If they are successful, Padres could move Austin Hedges in a deal for pitching. @MLBNetwork @MLB 
  
 While top prospect Fernando Tatis Jr. (MLB's No. 2 overall prospect) likely is off limits, San Diego can still offer Miami an attractive package from its talent-rich farm system, which has 10 players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 list. 
  
 Morosi notes that if the Padres are successful in landing Realmuto, they could turn around and trade backstop Austin Hedges for pitching. The club's current catching situation includes Hedges and No. 3 prospect Francisco Mejia (No. 26 overall), who was acquired from Cleveland for Brad Hand and Adam Cimber this past season. 
  
 Interestingly, the Padres and the division-rival Dodgers are two of the top suitors for both Kluber and Realmuto. It's possible whichever team doesn't land Kluber will get Realmuto instead, though there are other teams in the mix for each player. 
  
 If Marlins deal Realmuto, which prospects should they target? 
  
 Dec. 20: We've been hearing plenty about J.T. Realmuto rumors lately, so much so that a few names of elite, high-end outfield prospects from interested suitors have been floated: Kyle Tucker of the Astros, Alex Verdugo of the Dodgers and Jesus Sanchez of the Rays. 
  
 How do they stack up against each other, and which should the Marlins be most focused on trying to acquire if they actually move their All-Star catcher? MLB.com's Jonathan Mayo answered just this question, so here's the MLB Pipeline prospect guru to take it away. 
  
 "All three of the outfielders mentioned ... are very talented and all are in the top 35 of our current Top 100 prospects list," Mayo writes. "Now, that list will be re-ranked in late January 2019, but there's no question Tucker is the best of this group. Ranked No. 5 overall, Tucker had an outstanding 2018 campaign, very small sample size of big league play aside. He turned in his second straight 20-20 season, hitting .332 and leading the Pacific Coast League with a .989 OPS. Oh, and he was only 21 years old. 
  
 "Verdugo and Sanchez are back-to-back in the rankings, at No. 32 and 33. Verdugo continued to show he can hit with an advanced approach, finishing with a .329/.391/.472 line in Triple-A as a 22-year-old. That was a career high for a full season in terms of SLG. Sanchez played the 2018 season at age 20 and hit for average and developing power, earning a promotion up to Double-A. Personally at this point, I'd probably rank Sanchez ahead of Verdugo because I think he has a higher ceiling. But Verdugo is ready to contribute right now, while Sanchez might need another year in the Minors, so if a team is looking for a more immediate return, Verdugo might be ranked slightly ahead, with Tucker leading the pack." 
  
 There you have it. Now it's just a simple matter of whether the Marlins can get the Astros, Dodgers or Rays to part with one of the above as part of a deal -- if Miami does, in fact, decide to deal Realmuto. ||||| Major League Baseball and its players’ union agreed on random, in-season blood testing for human growth hormone in an expansion of the sport’s antidrug program. 
  
 The package also will add procedures to detect improper testosterone use by players, MLB and the union said in a joint news release. 
  
 The announcement bolsters baseball’s position as having the strictest drug rules of the four major U.S. professional leagues. It also comes a day after Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, the two most decorated players in baseball history, were snubbed for the sport’s Hall of Fame because of ties to performance-enhancing drugs. 
  
 “I am proud that our system allows us to adapt to the many evolving issues associated with the science and technology of drug testing,” baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement. “We will continue to do everything we can to maintain a leadership stature in antidoping efforts in the years ahead.” 
  
 Michael Weiner, executive director of the MLB Players Association, said in November that stricter drug rules probably would be announced before the 2013 season. 
  
 “Players want a program that is tough, scientifically accurate, backed by the latest proven scientific methods, and fair,” Weiner said in a statement today. “I believe these changes firmly support the players’ desires while protecting their legal rights.” 
  
 Lab Work 
  
 The sport has authorized the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Montreal laboratory to establish a program to track players’ baseline testosterone/epitestosterone ratios, which will help detect when impermissible testosterone or other substances are being used. 
  
 Testosterone is a naturally occurring strength builder, and use of artificial or injected versions of the substance have been found in cases involving 2011 National League Most Valuable Player Ryan Braun, All-Star outfielder Melky Cabrera and pitcher Bartolo Colon. 
  
 HGH is considered a performance-enhancing drug because of its ability to grow muscle and aid recovery after training. It’s not detectable in urine, unlike anabolic steroids. 
  
 Tests for HGH in the major leagues have been limited to the offseason and spring training. Minor-league players have been tested since 2010, and former New York Mets first baseman Mike Jacobs became the first minor-leaguer to fail an HGH test, in August 2011. Neither the National Football League, the National Basketball Association nor the National Hockey League test for HGH. 
  
 Same Penalties 
  
 Penalties for drug use weren’t changed. Players are given a 50-game suspension for a first positive test, 100 games for a second positive and a lifetime ban from the game for a third infraction. 
  
 Today’s announcement comes more than five years after former U.S. Senator George Mitchell issued a report following a 21-month investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. 
  
 Among Mitchell’s findings was that New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte received HGH injections in 2002 while recovering from an elbow injury. Pettitte verified the claims two days later. 
  
 Congressional Testimony 
  
 Pettitte told a U.S. congressional committee in December 2007 that he and Clemens, a 354-game winner with a record seven Cy Young Awards as his league’s best pitcher, both used HGH, a claim Clemens denied. Clemens, whose name was mentioned 82 times in Mitchell’s report, in June 2012 was acquitted of lying to Congress about performance-enhancing drug use. 
  
 He and Bonds, a record seven-time National League Most Valuable Player who was convicted in April 2010 by a federal jury in San Francisco of obstructing a probe of drug use by pro athletes, both were passed over for Hall induction, each getting less than half the vote percentage needed. 
  
 The Baseball Writers’ Association of America voted not to enshrine any major-leaguers this year.
