Haskell, who has won 62 caps, is in his second stint with Wasps having rejoined the club in 2012 following spells in New Zealand, France and Japan.
"It is the only Premiership club I have ever known and it feels like home - I have a burning desire to win more silverware," said Haskell, 30, who is the Coventry-based club's co-captain.
The length of the player's new deal at the Ricoh Arena has not been disclosed.
Fellow back-row forward Nathan Hughes has also extended his stay with the club, on a similar undisclosed-length deal.
Haskell helped to win both the Premiership title and the Heineken Cup in his first spell with Wasps between 2002 and 2009.

"Being 30, it was really important I chose a team I felt was going to compete and ultimately win silverware," Haskell told the club's website.
"With Dai Young in charge and our owner Derek Richardson at the helm, I felt Wasps were a team that would do that."
Haskell also revealed his international ambitions played a part in encouraging him to extend his stay at Wasps.
"We have a developing and exciting squad that I feel will continue in an upwards trajectory and only get better. It's an honour to be part of that process," he added.
"It was also important that I stayed in the UK to continue my quest to play for England again. Pulling on that white shirt is why I get up every day and I feel I still have more to give at that level."
