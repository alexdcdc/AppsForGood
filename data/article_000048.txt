Thomas Cook Airlines will operate a weekly flight between Glasgow and the American city next summer.
The airline said it was introducing the service following a series of one-off flights to the US in recent summers.
It will operate between 4 May and 31 October next year, using the airline's Airbus A330 fleet.
Christoph Debus, chief executive of Thomas Cook Airlines, said: "It's fantastic news that we are able to start a regular flight to Las Vegas next summer as a result of the great support and feedback we've received when we've operated individual flights to the US.
"It's great news for holidaymakers, too, that they now have even more choice when looking for long-haul flights from Glasgow to this increasingly popular destination."
Glasgow Airport welcomed news of the new route.
Commercial director Francois Bourienne said: "Las Vegas attracts tens of millions of visitors every year and this will be the first time Scotland will have had a regular service to what is often referred to as the entertainment capital of the world.
"Not only is Thomas Cook's decision to introduce a weekly service to Las Vegas for the duration of the 2015 summer season excellent news for Glasgow Airport and our customers, it further strengthens our already extensive long-haul offering."
The airline has also announced an additional flight to Tunisia with flights available three times a week in the summer of 2015.
