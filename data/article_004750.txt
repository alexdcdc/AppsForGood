The Donegal GAA County Board met to discuss and vote on the option of granting a long-term deal for the county boss in Ballybofey on Monday.
Gallagher had completed two years of his initial three-year term.
Donegal lost to Tyrone in the Ulster SFC final in July and then went down to Dublin in the quarter-finals of the All-Ireland series in August.
Gallagher, who succeeded All-Ireland winning manager Jim McGuinness in the job, is understood to have made the case to extend his stay to a special review committee last week.
The Executive Committee then brought forward their proposal to club delegates, who debated the matter on Monday evening.
With senior players Eamon McGee and Colm McFadden having retired, the former St Gall's clubman faces undertaking a rebuilding process.
A number of players such as captain Michael Murphy and Ryan McHugh have spoken out in support of their manager in recent weeks.
