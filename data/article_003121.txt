The 21-year-old, who was 32 weeks pregnant, lost her baby after being attacked by two men in Peckham, south London, on Monday evening.
Kevin Wilson, 20, of Stansfield House, Longfield Estate, south-east London, is due in court later.
The woman waited more than an hour for an ambulance that never arrived.
She was eventually taken to hospital by police after a 70-minute wait but lost her baby in the early hours of Tuesday.
The London Ambulance Service issued an apology for no ambulance reaching her and said the first 999 call, made by a member of the public, had been assessed as a "lower priority call".
The call was made at 20:16 BST on Monday and the Metropolitan Police cancelled the request for an ambulance at 21:25 when its officers took the woman to hospital.
She is said to still be in a critical condition.
Police said the woman was pushed to the ground by two men in motorcycle helmets who allegedly kicked and stamped on her stomach.
Detectives said she was in intensive care but had managed to provide an account of the attack to officers.
The attackers ran off and no motorbike was found, with police saying the helmets may have been worn as a disguise.
Police said they wanted any witnesses to come forward.
Mr Wilson is due to appear at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court. The charge of child destruction is under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929.
