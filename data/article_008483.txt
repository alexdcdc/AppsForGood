“The internet’s completely over. I don’t see why I should give away my new music to iTunes or anyone else. They won’t pay me an advance for it and then they get angry when they can’t get it. The internet’s like MTV. At one time, MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated. Anyway, all these computers and digital gadgets are no good. They just fill your head with numbers and that can’t be good for you.” ||||| FILE - In this June 2, 2010 file photo, musician Kenny G takes a picture at the premiere of "Splice" in Los Angeles.

 Kenny G isn't bowing down to Prince. 
  
 The saxophonist candidly joked in response to a recent interview in which Prince said the Internet is completely over. 
  
 Kenny G says if the Internet is dead "then I must be dead, too, 'cause I use it all the time." He adds with a laugh: "Maybe I've got a sixth sense, and I only see dead people. I don't know." 
  
 The 54-year-old admits the majority of his audience may not be as "Internet and download savvy" like fans of singer Rihanna, but he knows he must use the outlet to promote his music. 
  
 Prince refuses to use digital platforms to distribute his music. But Kenny G says he will do what it takes to stay connected, especially since he just released a new album, the R&B-flavored "Heart & Soul."
