Kitchen units, a hob, fridge freezer, dishwasher and sink were taken from the site in Crocketford.
The theft happened at the Ottersburn development in the village some time between Friday and Tuesday.
The units taken were Porter Alabaster rigid cabinets and the total value of the goods taken about Â£7,500.
Police have asked anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area to contact them.
PC Victoria Thomson said "Clearly this theft would have taken a bit of time and a large vehicle to remove all the units and appliances.
"We are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area of the Ottersburn development over the weekend to give us a call if they saw or heard anything suspicious."
