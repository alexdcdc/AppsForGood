The 31-times capped international has had surgery on a fractured metatarsal likely to keep him out for 12 weeks.
He will miss March's friendlies against Northern Ireland and Ukraine but hopes manager Chris Coleman will take previous performances into account.
"There are a lot of people vying for the central midfield spots," he said.
Pontesbury-born Edwards suffered the injury during last Saturday's 1-1 Championship draw at QPR.
The injury will leave the former Shrewsbury and Luton Town player with little time to prove his fitness for this summer's European Championship finals in France.
"It's definitely going to be difficult," added Edwards. "I just hope, when there were a couple of injuries a few months ago and I stepped in, there was enough in my performances to show the manager that I'm worthy of getting picked.
"It's obviously a big blow that I'm not going to be involved in the upcoming friendlies because these sort of games are quite big for selection."
Chris Coleman's side will host Northern Ireland on Thursday, 24 March in Cardiff before facing Ukraine at Kiev's NSK Olympiyskiy Stadium four days later.
