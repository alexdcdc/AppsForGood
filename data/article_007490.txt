Steven Kirkwood, 43, is accused of stabbing and killing Mr O'Hanlon, 45, in Stevenston, North Ayrshire, in July.
The attack is said to have occurred at HK Autotek in the town's Moorpark Industrial Estate.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Mr Kirkwood's lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Judge Lord Burns set a trial due to take place next May.
Prosecutors allege that Mr Kirkwood struggled with Mr O'Hanlon, punched him and repeatedly struck him on the body with a knife or similar item.
Mr Kirkwood also denied separate charges of having a blade in a public place and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
