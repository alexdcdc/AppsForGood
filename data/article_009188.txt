LONDON -- President Trump had a wide-ranging interview with journalist Piers Morgan on ITV Sunday night where he revealed that he tweets in bed and how he would have taken a "tougher" attitude toward Brexit negotiations than the approach now being used by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Without providing specifics, Mr. Trump says he would have used different tactics. 
  
 "Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate it the way it's (being) negotiated ... I would have had a different attitude," he says. 
  
 He says: "I would have said that the European Union is not cracked up to what it's supposed to be."

 Mr. Trump also mentioned Sunday that he would make a trade deal with the United Kingdom. 
  
 Britain is preparing to leave the European Union in March 2019. The complex negotiations have moved slowly and May's Cabinet seems deeply divided over how best to separate Britain from the 28-nation bloc. 
  
 In the interview, Mr. Trump said he looks forward to visiting Britain, where he has been invited for a state visit to be hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. 
  
 During the interview, Mr. Trump was social media is a way to defend himself in an era of "fake news" and that he sometimes tweets from bed. 
  
 "Well perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatver, but generally speak during the early morning, or the evening...I am very busy during the day." 
  
 He also said he was willing to apologize for retweeting anti-Muslim videos by a far-right group in Britain, which exacerbated tensions with May and drew complaints in Parliament. Discussing the upcoming royal wedding that will feature an American bride, he says Britain's Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle, look like a "lovely couple" and says he doesn't know if he's been invited to their May 19 nuptials. 
  
 Told that Markle backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has described Trump as "divisive," the president struck a friendly note: "Well, I still hope they're happy," he says. 
  
 Mr. Trump also says that his administration might not withdraw from the Paris climate accord if terms more favorable to the United States are reached, in part because he likes French President Emmanuel Macron. 
  
 "No I like him, he's a friend of mine, Emmanuel! He's a great guy, his wife is fantastic I like him a lot," Mr. Trump said. "We had dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower." 
  
 Mr. Trump also mentioned that he would re-enter the Paris Climate Accord, but it has to be a good deal for the United States. 
  
 The interview was conducted Thursday during Mr. Trump's brief visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

 When Mr. Trump was asked about criticism from some women, he said he supported women and that many women understood that. He also mentioned that they like his support for a strong military as they often wanted to feel safe at home. 
  
 Mr. Trump also said he had tremendous respect for women, but when pressed further, said he was not a feminist. 
  
 The guest list for Harry and Markle's May 19 wedding at Windsor Castle has not been made public. The prince's press team said invitations have not been sent out yet. It is not clear if a final list has been drawn up. 
  
 The British press has been filled with speculation that Harry and Markle might snub Mr. Trump and invite former U.S. President Barack Obama as a wedding guest. The prince and Mr. Obama have met on several occasions, and Mr. Obama gave Harry a rare interview last year that was broadcast on the BBC. 
  
 Mr. Trump, in contrast, has angered many people in Britain with his crackdown on immigration and his climate change policies. 
  
 During the interview, he seemed open to revisiting his pledge to withdraw from 2015 Paris climate accord if the deal could be substantially revised. Under the pact, nations set their own goals to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases. Because of legal technicalities America can't get out until November of 2020. 
  
 "If somebody said, go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal," Mr. Trump says. 
  
 "Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel (Macron). I would love to, but it's got to be a good deal for the United States." 
  
 Mr. Trump said the climate has been cooling as well as warming and asserted that ice caps have not been shrinking as predicted. 
  
 "The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records," he said. 
  
 However, those remarks don't quite match what data shows and scientists say. The world hasn't been cooling except for normal day-to-day weather variations; it has been just the opposite. And there have been far more records for shrinking ice on the top and the bottom of the world than growing, despite what the president claimed. ||||| LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, who has garnered a large following on social media with rambunctious postings, said he sometimes tweets from bed, though he occasionally allows others to post his words.

 Trump frequently uses Twitter to announce policy, assail his adversaries and to tangle with countries, including North Korea, over world affairs. The @realDonaldTrump account had 47.2 million users as of Sunday. 
  
 In an interview with Britain’s ITV channel, he appeared to appreciate the wide impact of his postings in Twitter and said that he needed social media to communicate with voters in the era of what he termed fake news. 
  
 “If I don’t have that form of communication I can’t defend myself,” Trump said in an interview broadcast on Sunday. “I get a lot of fake news, a lot of news that is very false or made up.” 
  
 It was a crazy situation, he said, that many people in the world waited for his tweets. He usually tweets himself, sometimes from bed. 
  
 When asked about whether he was lying in bed with his phone thinking of how to wind people up, Trump said: “Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever, but generally speaking during the early morning, or during the evening I can do whatever, but I am very busy during the day, very long hours. I am busy.” 
  
 “I will sometimes just dictate out something really quickly and give it to one of my people to put it on,” he said. 
  
 Asked about eating burgers and drinking Coke, Trump, 71, said: “I eat fine food, really from some of the finest chefs in the world, I eat healthy food, I also have some of that food on occasion... I think I eat actually quite well.” 
  
 Trump said that he was very popular in the United Kingdom. Some British politicians have called for Trump not to visit and 1.86 million people have signed a petition asking for him to be banned from entering the United Kingdom. 
  
 “I get so much fan mail from people in your country - they love my sense of security, they love what I am saying about many different things,” Trump said. 
  
 BREXIT 
  
 Trump would take a “tougher” approach to Brexit negotiations than British Prime Minister Theresa May. 
  
 When asked if May was in a “good position” regarding the ongoing Brexit talks, Trump replied: “Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn’t negotiate it the way it’s [being] negotiated ... I would have had a different attitude.” 
  
 Pressed on how his approach would be different, he said: “I would have said the European Union is not cracked up to what it’s supposed to be. I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out.” 
  
 He said the United States would do a post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom. 
  
 He was pressed on how some women opposed him and he said he supported women and that many women understood that. 
  
 Trump said women in particular liked his support for a strong military as they often wanted to feel safe at home. 
  
 “There’s nobody better than me on the military... I think women really like that. I think they want to be safe at home,” Trump said. “I have tremendous respect for women.” 
  
 “No, I wouldn’t say I am a feminist. I mean, I think that would be maybe going too far: I am for women, I am for men, I am for everyone.” 
  
 He said French President Emmanuel Macron was a friend and that he liked him a lot. ||||| A round-up of some of the more eyebrow-raising statements in the US president’s interview with Piers Morgan
