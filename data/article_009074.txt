The 31-year-old paceman has flown to Dublin as cover, despite not being in the Black Caps' Champions Trophy squad.
He could be absent for Essex's next four One-Day Cup matches and the County Championship Division One game against Hampshire, which starts on 19 May.
Wagner has taken 21 wickets for the county so far this season.
And Essex say they will be keeping "an open line of communication" with New Zealand as the tri-series progresses.
Wagner is due to be replaced at Essex later this summer by Pakistan's Mohammad Amir.
