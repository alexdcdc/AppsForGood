Mr Wilson was 21 when he went missing from his home in the Falls Road area of west Belfast in 1973.
He is believed to have been abducted and murdered by the IRA.
On Tuesday, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) said results of DNA tests confirmed the remains were Mr Wilson's.
His body will now be released to his family.
Members of the Wilson family had just attended a walk at Stormont in memory of the Disappeared on 2 November when a call came through to say his remains had been found.
His sister, Anne Connolly, said it was a shock to learn recently that he might be buried in Waterfoot as her mother, Lily, who died three years ago, often sat on village beach.
She spoke of a "mixture of relief, and great sadness" to learn that his body had been found so soon after the dig began.
Archaeologists and other experts had been examining the beach at Waterfoot in the Glens of Antrim after a tip-off to the ICLVR.
The commission has now overseen the discovery of seven bodies and numerous searches since it was set up in 1999 to locate those murdered and buried in secret graves by republican paramilitaries during the troubles.
Remains found in County Monaghan in July were confirmed as being those of Crossmaglen man Charlie Armstrong, a 57-year-old father-of-five who went missing on his way to Mass in 1981.
In October, the remains of Mr Armstrong's neighbour, Gerry Evans, were found at a site in County Louth.
