Five CCTV cameras have been set up in rural areas across the city.
Government figures showed there were 29,253 fly-tipping incidents in West Yorkshire alone which costing councils a total of Â£1.7m to clear.
Strategic director for environment Steve Hartley said the aim was to provide evidence for the courts.
"Installing the cameras is just one of a number of things we do to deter fly-tippers, catch offenders and encourage people to dispose of their waste responsibly.
"If rubbish is tipped on council land we clean it up as soon as possible and we try to ensure private landowners do the same." he said.
