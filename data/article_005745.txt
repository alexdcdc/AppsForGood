Currently smoking on such sites is allowed in designated areas or shelters, which will be removed.
Patients due to be admitted to hospital will be offered help and support from the Quitline Stop Smoking Service.
Dr Stephen Bridgman, Medical Officer of Health, said: "It shows our commitment to the health and wellbeing of the people who visit and use our premises."
He said: "However, I am also aware that this represents a significant change for staff who work on these sites as well as visitors and service users.
"It is for this reason that we are providing plenty of warning of these changes and support for those people who may be affected."
