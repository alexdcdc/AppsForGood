We all know you can't tell a book by its cover, but can you tell a film by its release date? Where "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit," is concerned, that becomes a bit of a trick question. 
  
 A glance at the calendar reminds us that this tale of espionage and derring-do starring Chris Pine as CIA analyst Jack Ryan is coming to theaters in January, the traditional elephant burial ground for major studio releases. 
  
 But before "The Wolf of Wall Street" dislodged it into 2014, "Jack Ryan" possessed a coveted Christmas slot all its own. So is this film a holiday gem slumming in the low-rent district, or a tawdry impostor stripped of ideas above its station? The answer lies somewhere in between.

 As directed by Kenneth Branagh, who costars along with fellow Brit Keira Knightley, this "Jack Ryan" has the additional burden of being the fifth film celebrating the exploits of the wily operative previously played by Alec Baldwin ("The Hunt for Red October"), Harrison Ford ("Patriot Games," "Clear and Present Danger") and Ben Affleck ("The Sum of All Fears"). 
  
 Compared to those films, as well as the modern gold standard of the genre as represented by the "Bourne" epics, "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" comes off as a reasonable facsimile, serviceable but not compelling, something that could pass for the real thing if you're not looking too hard. 
  
 Because this is a combination reboot/origins story, as well as the first Ryan story not based directly on one of Tom Clancy's bestselling novels, screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp have taken it upon themselves to fashion an elaborate back story for Ryan. "Shadow Recruit" introduces him as a student at the London School of Economics who patriotically joins the Marines after 9/11 only to be blown out of the sky over Afghanistan.

 The silver lining to that near-fatal situation turns out to be twofold. Ryan meets Cathy Muller (Knightley), the comely medical student involved with his rehab at Walter Reed who becomes the love of his life, and he catches the attention of Naval Cmdr. William Harper (Kevin Costner), a steely sort who recruits the young man for the CIA. 
  
 Pine, a capable actor who is just as he should be as Captain Kirk in the ongoing rebooting of the "Star Trek" franchise, is clearly intended to be the recipient the torch of the Jack Ryan franchise is being passed to. 
  
 Though Pine is acceptable in this latest rebooting, what Cmdr. Harper calls the "Boy Scout on a field trip look" he falls prey to emphasizes the absence of the kind of gravitas that Costner himself employs, and that is a chink in the younger actor's acting armor.

 The bulk of "Shadow Recruit's" action picks up 10 years after he signs with the agency. Ryan works as a compliance officer for a major Wall Street firm and, without telling live-in fiancée Cathy, also toils as a numbers cruncher for the CIA. When a clandestine meeting with fellow operatives is necessary, it takes place at Manhattan's Film Forum, providing a nice plug for this estimable movie house. 
  
 Smarter and more diligent than most, Ryan discovers that the pesky Russians his firm is doing business with seem to be hiding enormous amounts of money. The CIA wants him to go to Moscow and audit everyone's books, a situation that, in one of the film's less convincing plot strands, makes fiancée Cathy nervous enough to show up in the Russian capital as well. 
  
 It will come as no surprise that those Russians do have something underhanded up their sleeve. Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov has an uncredited cameo as a nefarious government minister, but the key culprit is a poetry-loving plutocrat named Viktor Cherevin, a juicy part that director Branagh has kept for himself.

 Branagh does an excellent job as the dour, fanatical Cherevin, a man with more secrets than St. Basil's Cathedral has onion domes, and his machinations are so threatening to American interests that the formerly desk-bound Ryan is forced to go operational in a big way. 
  
 Though the considerable action in "Shadow Warrior's" second half is briskly done, there is no shaking the feeling that Branagh and his cast are a kind of an espionage film B team, capable of mild diversion but nothing more.

 kenneth.turan@latimes.com ||||| Who is Jack Ryan? 
  
 With �Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,� this character, drawn from the late Tom Clancy�s novels, has now been played by four actors since 1990�s �The Hunt for Red October.� Alec Baldwin played him in �Hunt,� next came Harrison Ford in �Patriot Games� and �Clear and Present Danger� in the mid-�90s, then Ben Affleck took a shot in 2002�s �The Sum of All Fears.� 
  
 Now, after a decade, Ryan returns, younger than ever, with Chris Pine in the role. �Shadow Recruit� is basically an origins movie, and yet we still learn very little about the character at the center of all these films. 
  
 He�s mostly a gung-ho, all-American spy guy who gets into situations where he has to save the world from massive calamities. Yet you get the feeling that if you waved a hand in front of his eyes he wouldn�t blink. It�s hard to find anybody in there. 
  
 This can hardly be blamed on Pine, who has filled the personality of Captain Kirk to near bursting in the current �Star Trek� reboot. When Pine gets to actually do something � like fight for his unlikely survival early on in this film � he�s effective enough. But too much of the time Ryan is simply passing through some watered-down Bond-Mission:Impossible-Bourne hoops where he�s nothing more than the sum of his situation. 
  
 We begin with Ryan seeing the Sept. 11 attacks on a TV screen while studying something or other in England. Then he�s an officer in Afghanistan, flying in a helicopter that promptly gets blown out of the sky, which lands him, partially paralyzed, in a Washington hospital where a slumming Kiera Knightley plays the doctor who must teach him to walk again. 
  
 With Knightley as an eventual prize, he does indeed walk and even run again (wouldn�t you?). And around then a CIA guy named Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner, nice and cool) shows up. He�s noticed Ryan is brave and brilliant, how would he like to be a spy? 
  
 So Ryan is set up with a Wall Street firm where he secretly hunts for nefarious international doings while shacked up with the aforementioned doctor. One day, he stumbles on a problem with some Russian accounts and suddenly finds himself activated as an agent and sent overseas to investigate. 
  
 What he discovers is a Russian bad guy (Kenneth Branagh, also directing) on the verge of both a financial and terrorist attack on the United States (as if we�re not capable of engineering our own financial disasters). And thus begin all the Bond-Mission:Impossible-Bourne hijinks, including time-ticking sticky situations, assorted car chases, fisticuffs and � good news, locals! � a terrorist plot hatched in Dearborn. 
  
 Detroit pride indeed. 
  
 Branagh runs through all of this efficiently enough, but it feels awfully familiar. 
  
 And Ryan � well, Jack, we still hardly know you. 
  
 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' 
  
 GRADE: C+ 
  
 Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and intense action, and brief strong language 
  
 Running time: 105 minutes ||||| In “Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,” we learn that Greenwich Village’s lefty haven Film Forum is the favorite place in town for CIA agents to swap files, which is as I always suspected. Next we’ll hear about how Rumsfeld and Cheney plotted the Iraq War from the restrooms at CBGB, and it’s well known that Henry Kissinger frequented Studio 54, which is where he and Cher first got the idea to manufacture the oil crisis. 
  
 Despite the occasional hard-to-believe moment, the reboot of the 1990s franchise (later doomed by Ben Affleck, before the next “Batman” turns him into a serial franchise killer) is soundly structured, smart and fast, with a plausible central scenario, several gripping moments and well-wrought dialogue. If it isn’t quite as gritty or intelligent as the Bourne movies it is — as Ryan responds when asked if he’s still “intact” after nearly taking a few unexpected bullets — close enough. 
  
 “Jack Ryan” is also — a major point of relief with me — considerably less frivolous than most of the Bond and “Mission: Impossible” films about what it might be like to be an international man of mystery. If the star can brush everything off without even unknotting his tie, and crack jokes as he goes, so much for intensity. And Chris Pine is much less blockish here than in “Star Trek,” with his callow quality serving him well as an often-terrified newbie economics Ph.D. and ex-Marine combatant recruited by a CIA operative (Kevin Costner) to follow terrorism’s money trail while undercover at a Wall Street firm. 
  
 Under pressure, Pine gets red-faced and sweats instead of quips as his investigation of Russian banking transactions leads him to a cold-blooded Moscow financier (a chilling Kenneth Branagh, also the film’s director) who is engineering a simultaneous 9/11-style bombing and financial attack. 
  
 Jack’s girlfriend Cathy (Keira Knightley), the doctor who helped him recover after he was nearly killed fighting in Afghanistan, thinks he’s having an affair when she finds that Film Forum ticket stub and declines to marry him out of general suspicion — but he can’t tell anyone but his spouse about his secret life, so she can’t know. Even when she finds a firearm in his room, though, she considers that evidence of cheating, which seems obtuse in a feminine way: Honey, your man needs only one pistol to fool around, not two. 
  
 Knightley, though occasionally annoying (her patented gape-smile is getting old), anchors perhaps the best scene in the movie when, having been drawn into the plot, she must divert Branagh’s Cherevin by talking about Russian literature while her boyfriend downloads every villainous file from the evil mainframe. She’s a doctor, not a kickboxer, and the movie doesn’t burn off credibility by giving her ridiculous stunts, while the tender moments with Jack lay down a solid foundation for him to risk it all and tear after her in one of the admirably few, but potent, action scenes. 
  
 Keeping things nimble and clever (the financial scam makes scary sense, and how many blockbusters seamlessly work in themes from novelist Mikhail Lermontov?) brings the director total redemption after the unfortunate, nearly campy “Thor.” Branagh, that recovering Shakespearean, now looks like a reliable hand at le cinema du popcorn. 
  
 Equal credit goes to the script — based on Tom Clancy’s characters — by newcomer Adam Cozad and veteran David Koepp (“Jurassic Park”). An exchange worthy of John le Carré comes when Jack mentions he hurt his back in Afghanistan and Cherevin says icily, “Me too.” Two words tie together two eras and make clear why Cherevin hates America, for its support of the rebels during the Soviet invasion. Perhaps an even better line is the Costner character’s response to Ryan’s mildly insane (but perfectly correct) series of computations that lead to the conclusion that there’s a sleeper agent in Pennsylvania. Nah, says Costner: “Nobody blows up Pennsylvania.” |||||
