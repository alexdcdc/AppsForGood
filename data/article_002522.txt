The Grade II-listed Drummond Mill on Lumb Lane in Manningham was ravaged by a fire which started in the basement on Thursday.
The building has now been partially demolished to prevent further collapse.
Historic England said West Yorkshire's mills are "important landmarks which need to be cherished".
The organisation, which preserves and lists historic buildings, is currently part-way through a review into West Yorkshire's mills to establish best practice for future redevelopments.
Spokesperson Deborah Wall said: "The community is deeply affected and emotional about the loss of this historic building.
"It just shows how important these landmarks are to people and why the work to find ways to capture the stories of these places and to cherish them is so important."
Last month, property consultants Cushman and Wakefield began work with architects and Historic England to examine ways in which West Yorkshire's vacant textile mills could be brought back into use.
Trevor Mitchell, Historic England's planning director for Yorkshire, said: "West Yorkshire's textile mills are iconic buildings that people care deeply about.
"Some have been brilliantly and creatively converted into places to work, live or socialise.
"We are working to understand how these successful conversions have been achieved and try to find solutions for those mills that need a new purpose to become great landmarks in our region again."
Successful redevelopments include Tower Works and Marshalls in Leeds, Sunny Bank Mills in Pudsey, Lister Mills in Bradford, Salts Mill in Saltaire, Red Brick Mill in Batley, and Dean Clough in Halifax.
Yorkshire has 172 listed textile mills.
Ms Wall said the future of Drummond Mill was "totally uncertain" until Bradford Council and the fire service had determined the full extent of the damage.
