The game is expected to be a final farewell for South African World Cup winner Ruan Pienaar and long-serving back-row forward Roger Wilson.
Both players are leaving Ulster at the end of the season.
Ulster's last competitive home fixture is against Leinster on 6 May but the side could earn a Pro12 top-four spot with the final in Dublin on 27 May.
The Irish Rugby Football Union refused to sanction a contract extension for Pienaar, who joined Ulster in 2010, due to its succession policy.
Wilson, 35, has made 219 appearances for Ulster in two stints having first made his debut in 2003.
Ulster Director of Rugby Les Kiss welcomed the Baa-Baas fixture being fixed for Belfast.
"We are delighted to be hosting such a high profile game at Kingspan Stadium," said Les Kiss.
"Not only will it give rugby supporters a chance to see some world class rugby, but it will also be an opportunity for them to say goodbye to some of the players who have contributed so much to the Ulster cause.
"The Barbarians against Fiji last November was a special occasion but I have no doubt that this event will exceed it, given our direct involvement in the match."
