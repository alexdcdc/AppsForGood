Houses would be built across 20 acres (eight hectares) of the Hendrefoilan site, around woodland and green space.
It is currently home to 1,644 students but the sale is part of a wider redevelopment at the university.
If approved, work could start in autumn 2015, following the completion of 892 student flats at Swansea's new Â£450m Bay Campus on Fabian Way.
Developer St Modwen intends to submit a planning application within the next six months.
The site is close to the university's main campus, Singleton Hospital, and is three miles away from Swansea city centre and Mumbles.
Swansea University pro-vice-chancellor Prof Iwan Davies said facilities, including a shop and student's union, would remain in use until students moved to the new campus.
The first phase of its science and innovation campus is currently being built and is expected to be completed by the summer of 2015.
The university estimates it contribute more than Â£3bn to the regional economy over the next 10 years and create thousands of jobs.
Plans include a research and testing facility operated in partnership with Rolls-Royce.
There will also be new teaching and research facilities for the university's engineering, business and economics, maths, and computer science departments as well as student residential accommodation.
