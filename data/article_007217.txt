 CLOSE "Despite the negative press covfefe," Trump wrote, and nothing more. The tweet was deleted, but only after it had been up for several hours. It gave Twitter a lot to chew on. USA TODAY 
  
 Donald Trump has been active on Twitter since his return from his first overseas trip as president. And he kept the ball rolling with a tweet shortly after midnight on Wednesday morning. 
  
 But it is not at all clear what the president was tweeting about. 
  
 "Despite the negative press covfefe," Trump wrote, and nothing more. The tweet was deleted later Wednesday morning, but only after it had been up for several hours.

 By the time the tweet was taken down, #covfefe was a trending topic. Trump played along with the "covfefe" jokes, writing, "Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ??? Enjoy!" in a post at 6 a.m. ET.

 Even if we assume "covfefe" was a typo and the president meant to type "coverage," it remains a mystery what the tweet refers to. 
  
 Perhaps it was meant as a follow-up to his previous tweet, in which he retweeted a Fox and Friends tweet citing an unnamed source who said, "Jared Kushner didn't suggest Russian communications channel in meeting."

 Unsurprisingly, most of Trump's fellow Twitter users jumped all over the apparent mistake. #Covfefe quickly became a trending topic, and a quick check on GoDaddy revealed the domain name covfefe.com was already taken.

 The meaning of "covfefe" may forever remain a mystery, but Trump's later tweets Wednesday were somewhat clearer. He slammed the Democrats, saying they no longer want his former adviser, Carter Page, to testify.

 He also went after comedian Kathy Griffin for the photo shoot in which she held up a mock decapitated head of the president.

 Puzzling tweet by US president leads, naturally, to madness on the internet 
  
 What is covfefe? The tweet by Donald Trump that baffled the internet 
  
 If you haven‚Äôt looked it up already, don‚Äôt bother. 
  
 Just after midnight in Washington, Donald Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúDespite the constant negative press covfefe.‚Äù That was it. No more. Just that word ‚Äúcovfefe‚Äù left hanging there.

 It left many of his 31 million followers on Twitter baffled, and slightly concerned.

 The tweet had been active on Trump‚Äôs account without comment or clarification overnight and was not deleted until shortly before 6am the following morning. Trump replaced it with a tweet reading: ‚ÄúWho can figure out the true meaning of ‚Äòcovfefe‚Äô ??? Enjoy!‚Äù 
  
 That it had not been immediately deleted was confusing to users who, in the hours between the two tweets, had indeed tried to work out what exactly Trump might have meant. 
  
 Clive Thompson (@pomeranian99) Does no one on staff have his password? Have they tried the most common ones? 123456, or 11111, or, like ... "password"?

 Others suggested the tweet had taken the heat off US comedian Kathy Griffin, who had earlier been under fire for posting a video in which she held a replica of Trump‚Äôs severed bloody head.

 Trump has been known to tweet on both Android and Apple devices in the past, but the ‚Äúcovfefe‚Äù tweet had been sent from the Twitter app on an iPhone. 
  
 The news site Axios had reported on Thursday that the president‚Äôs current device was an iPhone with only one app: Twitter. 
  
 It cited anonymous White House officials who said that limiting screen time was key to ‚Äúforcing a more disciplined President Trump‚Äù, as witnessed on his overseas tour: |||||
