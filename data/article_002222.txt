David Oliver, 51 of Coombe Gardens in Bournemouth, was convicted of six counts of indecent assault.
He was working as a leader at Butchers Coppice Scout Camp in the town at the time of the offences which took place in the late 1990s.
Dorset Police said he had "abused his position of trust".
He was given a two-year suspended sentence and placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years following a five-day trial at Bournemouth Crown Court.
Police said Oliver had taken advantage of his victim, who was under the age of 16, by kissing her and sexually assaulting her on a number of occasions.
The offences took place in a scout office and in the camp grounds and, on one occasion, in his car on the way to a camp in the New Forest.
Det Con Jo Shewbridge said: "Oliver used and abused his position of trust in the scouting movement to sexually assault his young victim.
"I wish to praise the bravery of his victim to come forward and report the offences."
