About 200 to 250 brain tumour cases are operated on in Northern Ireland each year.
Across the UK, more children and people under the age of 40 die of a brain tumour than any other cancer.
Dr Tom Flannery said that more funding into research on brain tumours was essential in order to lower the number of people dying from the disease.
Dr Flannery is the lead brain tumour researcher at the Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB) at Queen's.
The centre and theBrainwaves NIcharity are hosting an information evening on Wednesday to raise awareness about the prevalence of brain tumours.
Sandra McKillop from Brainwaves NI said: "There is a real need to accelerate progress and improve treatments and outcomes for those affected by a brain tumour in Northern Ireland.
"Research into brain tumours receives less than 1% of the national spend on cancer research and we, along with the researchers at Queen's, are calling for this to be increased.
