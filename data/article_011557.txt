The Adventure Travel in Scotland guide has been published by Tourism Intelligence Scotland (TIS).
It is aimed at helping companies make the most of new and emerging opportunities in the tourism sector.
Tourism bosses expect a 70% increase in people taking part in adventure travel over the next three years.
According to the guide, more than 3.2 million adventure holiday trips were made in Scotland in 2008, generating almost Â£900m of spending.
Adventure travel includes adventure sports and mountain biking, but also walking and wildlife watching.
The guide provides facts and figures about the market, emerging consumer trends and marketing tips to help operators attract more adventure travellers to their business.
Julie Franchetti, tourism innovation manager at Scottish Enterprise, said: "In the current economic climate, tourism businesses need to continue to look at new ways to innovate and grow their business.
"This guide will give them the knowledge and the tools to make the most of these new opportunities and ensure they meet, and exceed, the needs of these adventurous travellers."
Paul Easto, director of adventure travel company Wilderness Scotland, said good market intelligence was essential to any business.
He added: "For Scotland to thrive as an adventure travel destination, it is fundamentally important that all aspects of the tourism supply chain understand the specific needs and expectations of this market."
