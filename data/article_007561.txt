One case is in a man and the other in an older woman. Both have recovered from the infection.
They both have a history of travel to a Zika affected country. The Republic of Ireland's Health and Safety Executive has said the cases are unrelated.
The World Health Organization has declared Zika a global health emergency as it spreads through the Americas.
Zika is carried by mosquitoes and has been linked to thousands of suspected cases of underdeveloped brains.
The HSE said neither of the confirmed cases in Ireland is "at risk of pregnancy".
It said that infection usually results in a mild illness lasting between two and seven days.
The HSE statement advises people who become ill within two weeks of their return to Ireland from an affected area to contact their doctor for assessment.
"The finding of Zika cases in Ireland is not an unexpected event as many other European countries have reported cases as a result of travel to affected areas," it said.
"The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne infection, which isn't harmful in most cases.
"However, it may be harmful for pregnancies, as it's been potentially linked to birth defects, specifically, abnormally small heads [microcephaly]."
The virus is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, although it can also be sexually transmitted.
The US confirmed the first case of Zika contracted through sexual transmission in Dallas on Tuesday evening.
