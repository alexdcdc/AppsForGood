Emergency services were called Mossvale Nursery, in Fullerton Street, Paisley, at about 01:55.
About 25 firefighters were called in to tackle the blaze, with crews bringing it under control at about 04:30.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze was contained to one half of the nursery. The cause of the fire is not known.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: "Our firefighters were faced with a challenging fire within the nursery and their priority was to save as much of the building as possible.
"Through the efforts of the firefighters, the fire was successfully contained to one half of the nursery.
"Firefighters using a thermal image camera were able to check the building for hidden fire travel and effectively extinguish hotspots."
Renfrewshire Council said the nursery would be closed on Thursday but the adjoining St James Primary and Mossvale Primary would open as normal.
