Cardiff City Stadium will host the final on Thursday, 1 June 2017, with the men's final held at the Principality Stadium two days later.
Ludlow won the competition with Arsenal Ladies in 2007.
"It provides us with a massive opportunity to increase participation numbers and interest in Wales' national teams and domestic leagues," she said.
"Our younger national team players will be inspired seeing first-hand the pinnacle of women's club football."
Wales women's manager Ludlow and former Wales and Liverpool striker Ian Rush have been named as ambassadors for the 2017 finals.
Ludlow, who succeeded Jarmo Matikainen in October 2014, captained Arsenal to a 1-0 aggregate win over Swedish side Umea in the 2007 final when the competition was known as the Uefa Women's Cup.
"This competition, and the women's game in general, has changed massively since my trophy win in 2007," Ludlow added.
"Women's football is a growing sport and the standard is improving all the time. It will be an interesting final, and a real football spectacle when the final comes to Wales next year."
