Three restaurant chains - Frankie and Benny's, TGI Fridays and Nandos - want to open outlets at the site on the A96.
Another developer, Inverness Estates, had previously tried and failed to get similar plans approved by Highland Council.
The new proposals by Hercules Unit Trust submitted to the council also include a revamp of shop fronts.
A play area, toilets and baby changing area would also be created under the plans for the retail site, which has been rebranded as the Inverness Shopping Park.
The developers suggested some of the new jobs could be taken up by students attending the nearby Inverness College UHI.
Park manager Kirsteen Gunn said: "We hope the planners and councillors will look carefully at our analysis of potential impacts and allow us to create a better experience for our local customers and our staff, as well as visitors.
"We believe these improvements will be a positive move for the city and should be welcomed."
