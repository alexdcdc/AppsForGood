We have been cheated," he added.The bride's relatives informed the police.

 The bride tested the groom on his math skills and when he got the sum wrong, she walked out. 
  
 The question she asked: How much is 15 plus six? 
  
 His reply: 17. 
  
 The incident took place late Wednesday in Rasoolabad village near the industrial town of Kanpur in northern Uttar Pradesh state, local police officer Rakesh Kumar said Friday. 
  
 The groom's family tried persuading the bride to return, but she refused. She said the groom had misled them about his education. 
  
 "The groom's family kept us in the dark about his poor education," said Mohar Singh, the bride's father. "Even a first grader can answer this." 
  
 Local police mediated between the families and both sides returned all the gifts and jewelry that had been exchanged before the wedding, Kumar said. 
  
 Last month, another bride in Uttar Pradesh married a wedding guest after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed at the wedding venue. 
  
 The groom's family had not revealed that the groom was epileptic. While the groom was rushed to a hospital in Rampur town, the bride asked one of the wedding guests to step in and married him. 
  
 Most marriages in India are arranged by the families of the bride and groom. Except for brief meetings, the couple rarely gets to know each other before the nuptials. |||||
