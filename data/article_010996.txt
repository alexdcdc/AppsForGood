It is alleged Dr Reginald Bunting, who died in 2013, committed sexual offences against a number of past and present officers and staff with the force.
The other allegation is that when a number of officers came forward, their claims were not properly investigated.
The investigation will focus on how the force dealt with the complaints.
The doctor was employed by Avon and Somerset police force between 1972 and 2006.
The sexual assault allegations will be investigated separately by an independent retired officer from Merseyside Police, arranged by Avon and Somerset police.
The referral was made to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in July to determine the level of investigation required.
IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said: "We have decided to independently investigate how the complaints made by serving officers about Dr Bunting were dealt with on several occasions in 1990 and 1995. The IPCC is not investigating the sexual assault allegations against Dr Bunting."
