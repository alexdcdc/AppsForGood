The 31-year-old Glenullin club man captained the Oak Leaf county at Minor, Under-21 and senior level.
O'Kane led the Minors to the All-Ireland Championship in 2002.
"Ever since my father started taking me to Derry games as a child, all I wanted to do was to play for my county," he said.
"From the moment I first pulled on a Derry jersey as a minor in 2001, I could never have expected that 15 years later I would still be playing for my county.
"I have worked under six different management teams and can say that each one has worked hard for the good of Derry football and to develop both myself and all the players."
