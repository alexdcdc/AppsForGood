The 49-year-old Filipino man was jailed for life for the murders of two people and the poisoning of 20 others.
It is understood the deaths were suspected poisonings but police did not have enough evidence to prosecute.
Stockport coroner, John Pollard, said there was nothing at this stage to prove any link to Chua.
The inquests were postponed pending the conclusion of criminal proceedings.
