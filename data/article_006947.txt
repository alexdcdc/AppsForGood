Natasha Marke-Jones gave the visitors the lead in the 22nd minute, only for Amy Brodie to bring Scotland level within two minutes.
But Phoebe Richards restored the lead early in the second half and Wales hung on for a crucial win.
The remaining two matches are on Sunday at 14:00 BST and Monday at 11:00 BST.
Wales are ranked 26th in the world and are preparing for the European Championships in Cardiff this August, so will relish an important win over 17th-ranked Scotland.
