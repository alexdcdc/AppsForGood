Another worker is said to have been hurt clearing ordnance in Ramadi, 60 miles (100km) west of Baghdad.
Iraqi forces backed by coalition air strikes retook the city from IS last December, but mine-clearing has to be completed before residents can return.
The Foreign Office said it was in contact with Janus following the death.
According to the AFP news agency, the incident was also confirmed by the mayor of Ramadi, although he did not specify the nationality of the wounded contractor.
The incident is said to have taken place in the al-Malaab neighbourhood of Ramadi, the capital of the western Anbar province.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with the employer of a British national who has died in Iraq and have offered our support at this difficult time."
Dozens of Iraqi civilians have died in explosions while trying to return to their homes in the city.
Janus Global Operations began its work in April after being awarded the contract to clear thousands of devices and booby-traps left by IS.
It confirmed the death of the British contractor without providing further information.
