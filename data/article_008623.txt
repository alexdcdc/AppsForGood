A 16-year-old as well as 17 year-old Nicholas Ayala and 18-year-old Anthony Malcolm have been charged with first degree murder against 62-year-old Delfino Mora. 
  
 Two more teens have been charged in connection in the deadly attack on a 62-year-old man last week that was recorded and posted on Facebook the same day a judge denied bond for a 16-year-old.Nicholas Ayala, 17, and Anthony Malcolm, 18, were each charged with first-degree murder and robbery in the slaying of Delfino Mora, according to Chicago police.Both Ayala and Malcolm each took turns using a cell phone camera to record the Tuesday morning beating that killed Mora, authorities said.Ayala, of the 6300 block of North Talman Avenue, and Malcolm, the 5500 block of North Broadway, are expected to appear before a judge today.In court earlier in the day, Malik Jones, 16, of the 2400 block of West Thorndale Avenue, was ordered held without bail by Judge Adam Bourgeois for the first-degree murder charge. Jones, charged as an adult, is scheduled to appear for a preliminary hearing Monday.Mora, of the 6000 block of North Washtenaw Avenue in the West Rogers Park neighborhood, was found unconscious but breathing in an alley in the 6300 block of North Artesian Avenue just before 8 a.m. Tuesday. He was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Evanston in critical condition and died at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday. An autopsy by Cook County medical examiner's office found that the 5-foot-7-inch Mora died from blunt head trauma in an assault.Prosecutors didn't identify Ayala or Malcolm by name in court, but did detail their alleged roles in the attack.Jones was with two others when he confronted Mora Tuesday morning, asking him what he had in his pockets, prosecutors said. Jones then punched the victim in the jaw and he fell to the ground, hitting his head on the concrete, prosecutors said.The attack was videotaped on the defendant’s cell phone by one of the other individuals and was later put on Jones' Facebook page, prosecutors said. Jones had given his phone to that person before confronting Mora."It feels to us like they're making fun of my dad because he couldn't defend himself," said Angelica Mora, 17, Delfino Mora's youngest child. "They think posting a violent video makes them tough. It's like they want to get famous."The attack happened about 5 a.m. Tuesday. A passerby found Mora three hours later with blood streaming out of his nostrils and vomit next to his head, prosecutors said.A witness who knows Jones saw the video and passed it on until it eventually was seen by a co-worker of the victim's son, prosecutors said. The co-worker then got in touch with the victim's son, who identified his father in the video, prosecutors said. The video was then taken to police by witnesses.Jones, who officials say is a gang member, was arrested Saturday in southwest suburban Orland Hills with the cell phone. A search warrant was obtained and police seized the video as well, prosecutors said.Prosecutors also said that Jones admitted to detectives that he had hit Mora.Maria Carmen Mora, 59, said her husband of more than 40 years was a hard worker and the patriarch of the family that includes 12 children. The family started out very poor in Mexico, she said, so her husband, who had built his home in Michoacan, Mexico, came to the Chicago area to work home construction to support their children.A work accident about 15 years ago left him without full use of his right arm, she said, so he was unable to continue working. But Valentin Mora, 38, said his father's disability didn't keep him stuck inside. He would often walk around the neighborhood and collect cans to help support the family."He didn't like to sit at home – he liked to get up in the morning, grab the mail and collect cans," his son said. "He liked the extra money."Valentin Mora said his father had six girls and six boys, ranging in age from 17 to 40 years old. The family lived in its current North Side residence for more than 15 years, he said, and his father was well known in the neighborhood.Emmanuel Mora, 20, the family's youngest son, said his father was always smiling and making jokes, especially to make his 4-year-old grandson, Rodrigo Mora, laugh, he said.His father taught himself to play guitar, Emmanuel Mora said, and loved to strum and sing in his three-person band. He said his father would often play his guitar at home while Rodrigo sat alongside, idolizing and mimicking his grandfather's style. Delfino Mora loved entertaining family and friends with humor and music, family said."For now, things are really tough, but we're trying to stay strong," Emmanuel Mora said. "My mom is now the head of the family, and she's showing us how strong she can be. We're trying to be strong for her, too, because we don't want her to get sick or depressed."Angelica Mora said she was looking forward to having her father at her graduation from Mather High School next year."I think he'll still be there," Angelica Mora said. "I won't be able to see him, but he'll be there."The family is planning to take Delfino Mora's body back to Mexico to be buried sometime this week, Emmanuel Mora said. ||||| Three teens charged in videotaped fatal attack on disabled man BY KIM JANSSEN kjanssen@suntimes.com

 It was a move that was as dumb as it was callous, according to a prosecutor’s account. 
  
 But a teenage gang member’s decision to let his buddy film him as he fatally punched a 62-year-old disabled man in the jaw came back to haunt him, authorities said. 
  
 Malik Jones, 16, now faces first degree murder charges after police saw the video of the attack posted on his Facebook wall. Two others also were charged with murder: Nicholas Ayala, 17, of the 6300 block of North Talman, and Anthony Malcolm, 18, of the 5500 block of North Broadway, police said. 
  
 Father-of-12 Delfino Mora fell, hit his head and died as a result of the attack early Tuesday morning in a West Rogers Park alley, it’s alleged. 
  
 The video posted on Jones’s Facebook shows Mora’s skull make a sickening “crack�? sound as it hit the concrete ground in the 6300 block of North Artesian, Assistant Cook County State’s Attorney Sylvie Manaster said in court Sunday. 
  
 It was at least the third time over the past year that a Chicago attack was videotaped, leading to an arrest of one or more teens. 
  
 Manaster said Jones, of the 2400 block of West Thorndale, handed one of two accomplices his cell phone before the attack on Mora, who was scavenging for soda cans to make a little extra cash. 
  
 While his pal used the phone to film the attack, Jones asked Mora what he had in his pockets, then punched him in the jaw and fled, Manaster said. 
  
 Mora was found where he fell three hours later, unconscious with blood coming from a nostril and vomit next to his head, the prosecutor added. He was declared dead a day later at St. Francis Hospital. 
  
 But when a witness spotted the video on Jones’ Facebook, the crime started to unravel, authorities said. The witness forwarded it to a second witness, who identified Jones as the person who battered him in a separate incident June 30, Manaster said. 
  
 Those witnesses contacted one of Mora’s sons, who confirmed that it was Mora on the video, the prosecutor added. Police arrested Jones in south suburban Orland Hills on Saturday and recovered the cell phone with the video of Mora’s attack. 
  
 Jones later confessed to throwing the punch that felled Mora, she added. He’s a member of the Latin Kings street gang, with a tattoo of the words “Little Terror�? on his left arm and the words “f--- you, pay me�? on one of his hands, according to a police report. 
  
 Charged as an adult, he was denied bail Sunday by Judge Adam D. Bourgeois. 
  
 Mora’s death left two families bereft. 
  
 At Mora’s home a few blocks from the murder scene in the 6000 block of North Washtenaw, mourning relatives Sunday remembered Mora as a keen singer of Mexican Ranchera music and devoted dad to a dozen children and 23 grandchildren. 
  
 Badly injured 15 years ago in a workplace accident, Mora emigrated to Chicago in the 1980s from Michoacán, Mexico, and supplemented his meager disability payments by collecting soda cans early in the morning, said his son Emmanuel, 20. 
  
 “He was a very friendly, talkative guy — everyone liked him,�? Emmanuel Mora said, adding that his dad was a skilled musician who played guitar in a band called ‘Los Coralillos.’ “He was sarcastic and very funny,�? his son said. 
  
 One of six sons, Emmanuel Mora said he has had trouble sleeping since he saw the video of his dad’s death. 
  
 “I’ve been having nightmares — it’s been real hard but I have to be tough for my mother and my brothers,�? he said. “I don’t know how anyone can be that cold-hearted.�? 
  
 Mora’s devastated widow, Maria Carmen Mora, said through an interpreter that though Jones’s arrest will not bring her husband of 40 years back, “at least (Jones) will stay locked up and can’t do this to another family.�? 
  
 Jones’s mother also was moved to tears by news of her son’s arrest. Monique Hendrix said her son was a “known runaway�? who lived with his father and “has a problem with authority and just does not listen.�? 
  
 “I don’t know what to say...my heart goes out to this man’s family,�? she said, adding that her son has been in trouble with the law before. 
  
 “This is what happens when you don’t care about how you represent yourself out on the streets and you don’t care who you hurt,�? she said. 
  
 Jones’s father, Terry Jones, disputed Jones’ mother’s account of Jones’s living arrangements, saying his son most recently lived with her, until he started living on the street a week before Memorial Day. 
  
 Terry Jones said he last spoke to his son on the phone on Friday and was planning to see him on Saturday — a plan that was disrupted when his son was arrested. He added that his son’s troubles started with his gang afiliation, and worsened during a spell last year in juvenile detention in DuPage County. 
  
 A visitation for Mora will be held 2 p.m.- 8 p.m. Tuesday at Caribe Funeral Home, 3314 West Armitage. His family is collecting funds to send his remains to Mexico. 
  
 Donations can be made to Chase Bank account number 3038964317 in the name of Valentin Mora.
