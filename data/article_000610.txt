Hundreds of farmers supplying chickens to the poultry processing company are recipients of the heating subsidy.
Earlier Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said the meeting had raised "fresh concerns" over the operation of the scheme.
Poultry farmers use the wood chip boilers to heat the buildings where chicks are housed.
Many took advantage of the scheme to replace LPG heating systems.
In his statement, Mr Ó Muilleoir said the Moy Park briefing with his officials had raised "further issues".
But in a statement the company made no reference to any concerns about the operation of the scheme.
It said it had met officials from the departments of economy and finance in order to help find a solution "to secure the Northern Ireland RHI scheme within budget".
It said it had extensive experience of "benchmarked energy use" in the poultry industry.
That appears to be a reference to attempts to establish what would be considered acceptable levels of heat use by poultry farms.
Moy Park said it advocated "responsible use of heat".
The finance minister also said cost control proposals had been submitted to his department by Department of Economy officials on Monday evening only to be withdrawn 10 minutes later.
Mr Ó Muilleoir has already described the proposed cost control measures as a "sticking plaster".
He said he wasn't interested in a "botched solution to the RHI scandal".
