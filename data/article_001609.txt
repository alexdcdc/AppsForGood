Vasile Ciuca, 20, of Highfield Road in Felixstowe, was banned from driving for six months after it emerged he had repeatedly broken the speed limit on Ipswich's Orwell Bridge.
Magistrates in Ipswich found Ciuca guilty in his absence of the offences, which happened in October and November.
He was also convicted of failing to tell police who the car's driver was.
For each of the 11 occasions he was caught speeding, he was given three points on his licence. He then received an additional six points for each occasion for failing to tell police information about the driver.
Ciuca, who was driving a VW Bora car at the time of the offences, was also fined Â£660 and ordered to pay Â£149 in costs.
