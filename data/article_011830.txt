The environment charity said wind power produced the equivalent of 97% of Scotland's household electricity needs.
The contribution of wind power was calculated to be up by 16% on the previous year.
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said the use of renewables in Scotland had curbed millions of tonnes of carbon emissions.
The statistics compiled by WWF Scotland from data provided by information service WeatherEnergy indicated that in December, wind power generated in Scotland exceeded household electricity demand by 48%.
The charity has called on all political parties to put forward policies to make Scotland the EU's first fully renewable electricity nation by 2030.
Mr Banks said: "On average, across 2015, wind power generated enough to supply the electrical needs of 97% of Scottish households, with six months where the amount was greater than 100%.
And, in the tens of thousands of Scottish households that have installed solar panels, half or more of their electricity or hot water needs were met from the sun for the most of the year, helping those homes to reduce their reliance on coal, gas, or oil."
He added: "With 2016 being a critical year politically, we'd like to see each of the political parties back policies that would enable Scotland become the EU's first fully renewable electricity nation by 2030."
