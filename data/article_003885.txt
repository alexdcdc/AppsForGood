The Diocese of Coventry said Bishop Colin, 72, died at home on 10 July having been diagnosed with a brain tumour 22 months earlier.
He was the Bishop of Coventry from 1998 to 2008.
Preaching the sermon at Coventry Cathedral, the Bishop of Warwick said Bishop Colin "had a great gift of friendship".
During the service, The Right Reverend John Stroyan, who was appointed by Bishop Colin in 2005, said: "He had a way of making people feel good about themselves, and of believing in their God-given potential.
"Colin was clear that Christ belongs to the world not the Church.
"His international concerns were reflected in the House of Lords where he urged the House to understand better the religious issues that are integral to the Middle East.
"Colin demonstrated that loving our neighbour is not just a local matter, it involves crossing boundaries of race of culture and of faith."
The Most Reverend Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, who served under Bishop Colin for nine years in the Diocese of Coventry, said he would "miss him".
The Archbishop said: "Colin Bennetts was an outstanding bishop, a wonderful parish priest and an exceptional friend and mentor to a huge number of people.
"Having known him at Coventry I was indebted beyond measure to him for wise advice and faithful prayer.
"Travelling with him was a pleasure, observing him a lesson. He faced, with his wonderful family, his last illness with faith in Christ.
"I will miss him and pray for Veronica and the rest of the family."
