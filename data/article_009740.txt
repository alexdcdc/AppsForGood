It was the Scots' first tournament victory since 2010, drawing them level with Wales on five points.
The Welsh had led 14-0 but two tries, one converted, and a late penalty turned the match in Scotland's favour.
"It was a pretty single-minded determination to win this game and they managed to do that, which was great," Munro said.
"Hard work, belief in what we're doing, good game-plan, good bunch of players, team spirit - if you've got all those things you're going to go places.
"I'm really pleased for them, I'm very proud of them. They performed extremely well and they deserve it."
Munro's team had opened with an agonising defeat against Ireland, who scored a late try to win 22-15, and then lost heavily to France.
"You learn, that's what sport is," said Munro. "You have to learn from situations that you've been in.
"They were much more level-headed than they were against Ireland. There was a determination to not let Wales win rather than, 'I hope they don't win'. There's quite a difference there."
And, of Sarah Law's late penalty, Munro added: "I thought, 'she'll get this'.
"She missed a couple against Ireland. She's a pretty determined character and she's been working hard on her kicking. I actually didn't doubt it for a minute."
Law put the result down to greater poise from the hosts.
"We knew, as a squad, that the performances were getting better and better," she told BBC Scotland.
"We knew that going into the game if we performed the way we knew we could, we would be able to come away with a win and that's what we did.
"We talked about composure and finishing after chances when we got them and I think that's what was different."
