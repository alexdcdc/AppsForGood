The company exported 279,000 packets to the country in 2013 - up from 46,000 in the previous year.
The Canadian market now makes up about 40% of Mackie's export sales turnover.
The figures were announced as Commonwealth Games Secretary Shona Robison visited a store in Toronto which stocks the Perthshire firm's products.
Ms Robison has been in the country as the Queen's Baton Relay continues its journey through Canada.
Ms Robison said: "This is another terrific example of a Scottish firm making a big impact on the international stage, and it's great to see Scottish brands on supermarket shelves abroad.
"Mackie's have been working extremely hard to gain a foothold in Canada and this has resulted in tremendous sales figures - a six-fold increase in one year is remarkable."
Ronnie Wilson, commercial director for Mackie's Crisps, said: "The response to our crisps in Canada has been tremendous, and our Scottish provenance has proven to be a key selling point in this market.
"Following the introduction of our dedicated Canadian packaging at the beginning of this year, which is bilingual and features a prominent saltire flag, we now have scope to broaden our distribution into mass grocery channels.
"Furthermore, we are about to launch 13 new lines into the Canadian market - in addition to the nine lines we already supply there."
Mackie's Crisps was founded in 2009 as a joint venture between Aberdeenshire-based Mackie's of Scotland and Perthshire potato company Taypack.
