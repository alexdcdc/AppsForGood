 KILLEEN, Tex. — The Army specialist at Fort Hood who killed three and wounded 16 of his fellow soldiers on Wednesday had an angry dispute over a leave request shortly before the shooting rampage, a law enforcement official said Friday. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 After a meeting where he had sought a leave to attend to family matters, he was clearly agitated and disrespectful when his request was denied, said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation. 
  
 Fort Hood officials and a spokesman for Army investigators declined to comment on Friday about the meeting and its role in the shooting, but they confirmed in an afternoon news conference that the specialist, Ivan Lopez, became angry with soldiers from his unit before the attack. Two of those he killed were in his unit, a transportation battalion of the 13th Sustainment Command. Officials stressed that they had still not established a clear motive. 
  
 But in an interview with a local Mississippi television station, Theodis Westbrook, of Smithdale, Miss., the father of Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, who was wounded in the attack, said he was told that a soldier came to Fort Hood’s personnel office, where Sergeant Westbrook worked, to get a leave form. When one of the soldiers told the man to come back the next day to pick that form up, the man left, then returned with a gun and opened fire.

 “The first guy he shot right in front of my son was killed, and then he turned the gun towards Jonathan, aimed it, and fired,” Mr. Westbrook said. “I don’t know how many times he fired, but he hit my son four times.” 
  
 The Army has said that Specialist Lopez, who ended his rampage by fatally shooting himself, had been undergoing evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment for depression and anxiety. But the post commander, Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, said on Friday that his “underlying medical conditions” were not a direct factor in the shootings. 
  
 “We believe that the immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area,” General Milley said.

 On his Facebook page, Specialist Lopez expressed a variety of concerns — including outrage at Adam Lanza’s shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., the fear he felt in a convoy in Iraq and, more recently, anger with Army bureaucracy. He arrived on base in February after being transferred from Fort Bliss in El Paso. It was unclear how his writing might help explain his increasingly troubled state of mind. 
  
 “Given that the alleged shooter is deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did,” said Chris Grey, a spokesman for the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command in Quantico, Va., the lead agency investigating the shooting. 
  
 Specialist Lopez’s father released a written statement, in Spanish, on Friday in which he suggested that mental illness must have played a role in his son’s actions. “My son could not have been in his right mind,” said Ivan Lopez, the father. “This is not who he was.”

 The statement, released in Guayanilla, P.R., where Specialist Lopez grew up and where his family still lives, said that the deaths of his mother and grandfather, along with “the recent changes he experienced in his transfer to the base affected his condition as a result of his experiences as a soldier.” He was divorced from his first wife, who also lives in Puerto Rico with their two children. His second wife and a child lived with him in Texas. 
  
 The troubled Facebook posts and comments Specialist Lopez made in the last two years — which are only visible to his friends on the site — appeared as posts from “Ivan Slipknot,” his Facebook identity and a reference to a favorite heavy metal band, friends said. 
  
 On March 1, the same day he purchased the .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol he used in the attack, Specialist Lopez wrote an especially angry and vaguely threatening post. “My spiritual peace has all gone away, I am full of hate, I believe now the devil is taking me. I was robbed last night and I’m sure it was two flacos. Green light and thumbs down. It’s just that easy ...”

 The post was unclear about whether he was referring to an actual robbery, or a figurative robbery in which he was, perhaps, denied something that he felt was owed to him. The term “flacos” literally means thin people, but it is often used in a derogatory fashion to describe those who are too thin, implying that they are drug addicts. However, it is sometimes used to address another man, much as an English-speaking American might call a friend “dude.” 
  
 On Feb. 27, he posted a photo of what appeared to be a handgun with the comment “Plaka, plaka, plaka, plaka...,” Puerto Rican slang that means “Bang, bang, bang, bang...” 
  
 His posts in November showed him struggling with the death of his mother, Carmen Lopez, a nurse in Guayanilla who died that month, and grappling with problems with the Army at the time of his mother’s death.

 “In shock. Mom died today,” he wrote on Nov. 15. “Thanks for your condolences. I couldn’t answer your calls,” he wrote, blaming Army bureaucracy, which he described with a vulgarity. 
  
 One law enforcement official said Specialist Lopez had told others that he should have received more time off after his mother’s death. It was apparently a source of anger for him, the official said. “He felt like he wasn’t being treated fairly,” the official said. “He wasn’t getting what he felt he should have been entitled to.” 
  
 On Facebook, he made other posts that appeared noteworthy in light of the shooting. On Oct. 3, he wrote in English, without further explanation: “Looking for a target.” 
  
 On Dec. 9, he wrote of his tour of duty in Iraq: “Exact 1 year and 2 days ago, I went out of Iraq having seen, in Falluja, the most brutal explosion at about 1,200 meters.” He described what happened, writing that moments after he turned on the ignition of his vehicle, he saw the mushroom cloud of a large blast not far away. “I was only trying to concentrate on breathing deeply and keeping the focus I needed to finish the mission. There were hours of agony waiting for an attack by insurgents, but we were able to come out of Falluja alive. I was in vehicle #6. The worst part was that vehicle #5 was a diesel truck, the perfect target. And I only thought of seeing my family again.”

 General Milley stressed that Specialist Lopez appeared not to have experienced direct combat while in Iraq and that he was being evaluated for, but had not received a diagnosis of, post-traumatic stress disorder. “So far, we have not discovered any specific traumatic event, wounds received in action, contact with the enemy, or anything else specific that he may have been exposed to while deployed,” the general said. 
  
 Of the 16 people wounded on Wednesday, 10 have been treated and released. Three remained at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, and three others were recovering at the Fort Hood medical center. Army officials identified the three soldiers killed in the attack, for whom they planned on holding a memorial service next week: Sgt. First Class Daniel Michael Ferguson, 39, of Mulberry, Fla.; Staff Sgt. Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez, 38, of Aguadilla, P.R.; and Sgt. Timothy Wayne Owens, 37, of Effingham, Ill. 
  
 The first report of the shooting came in at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday, when two soldiers who were wounded made the first call to 911. Officials said the shooting spanned a matter of only minutes over an area encompassing two city blocks, unfolding both inside buildings and outdoors in and near the First Medical Brigade area. Specialist Lopez was mobile at one point, shooting at soldiers as he drove in his vehicle from one location to another. 
  
 He then approached a military police sergeant who responded to the 911 call. There was a verbal exchange between them, and then the sergeant drew her weapon and fired a round when Specialist Lopez brandished his weapon. He then placed his gun to his head and fired, killing himself, officials said. ||||| FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — The Fort Hood soldier who gunned down three other military men before killing himself had an argument with soldiers in his unit before opening fire, and investigators believe his mental condition was not the "direct precipitating factor" in the shooting, authorities said Friday.

 The base's commander, Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, made the remarks about Spc. Ivan Lopez's health a day after officials said his mental condition appeared to be an underlying factor in the attack. 
  
 On Friday, Milley said that an "escalating argument" precipitated the assault. 
  
 Also Friday, Lopez's father said his son had struggled with the recent deaths of his mother and grandfather and the stress of being transferred to a new base. 
  
 Lopez's father, who shares the same name, said his son was receiving medical treatment but was a peaceful family man and a hard worker. 
  
 "This is very painful for me," the elder Lopez said in the statement from his native Puerto Rico, calling for prayers for the dead and the 16 people who were wounded in the shooting rampage. "My son could not have been in his right mind. He was not like that." 
  
 Wednesday's attack was the second at the base since 2009, when 13 people were killed by Army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, who had said he was angry about being deployed to Afghanistan. 
  
 Lopez, an Army truck driver, did a short stint in Iraq in 2011 and told medical personnel he had suffered a traumatic brain injury. The 34-year-old was undergoing treatment for depression and anxiety while being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, base officials said. 
  
 But officials said Lopez did not see any combat in Iraq, and had not previously demonstrated a risk of violence. 
  
 He seemed to have a clean record that showed no ties to potential terrorists, though military officials said the investigation was ongoing. 
  
 A family spokesman said Thursday that Lopez was upset he was granted only a 24-hour leave to attend his mother's funeral in November. That leave was then extended to two days. 
  
 Three people who were critically injured in the attack improved to fair condition Friday at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple. A fourth victim was expected to be released later in the day. At the military's request, the hospital said, it would not make the wounded or their families available for media interviews. 
  
 Also Friday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz visited wounded at a military hospital. Cruz said he was inspired by a soldier who had suffered a bullet wound to his abdomen, but still shielded other soldiers and called 911. 
  
 Investigators searched Lopez's home on Thursday and questioned his wife, who declined to comment in Spanish when reached by phone by The Associated Press. 
  
 Lopez walked into a base building around 4 p.m. Wednesday and began firing a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol. He then got into a vehicle and continued shooting before entering another building on the Army post. He eventually was confronted by military police in a parking lot, Milley said. 
  
 As he came within 20 feet of a police officer, the gunman put his hands up but then reached under his jacket and pulled out his gun. The officer drew her own weapon, and the suspect put his gun to his head and pulled the trigger a final time, Milley said.

 Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico. ||||| FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — The three soldiers killed in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood by another military man had served in the military for years and been deployed to Iraq as well as other places. 
  
 Lt. Gen. Mark Milley on Friday identified those killed as 39-year-old Daniel Ferguson, of Mulberry, Fla.; 38-year-old Carlos Lazaney Rodriguez, of Puerto Rico; and 37-year-old Timothy Owens, of Effingham, Ill. 
  
 Milley says Spc. Ivan Lopez killed the three Wednesday at the military base after a verbal altercation that escalated. He then killed himself. 
  
 Ferguson was a transportation supervisor who had been deployed to Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
  
 Lazaney Rodriguez was a unit supply sergeant who had served in Kuwait and Iraq. 
  
 Owens was a heavy vehicle driver who had also been deployed in Iraq and Kuwait. ||||| Story highlights An "escalating argument" may have led to shooting, officials say 
  
 Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz visit some shooting victims 
  
 Gunman Ivan Lopez killed three people, wounded 16 others at the Army post 
  
 A memorial for three soldiers killed will be held at Fort Hood next Wednesday 
  
 Authorities investigating this week's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood said Friday that an altercation between Spc. Ivan Lopez and his fellow soldiers, rather than a medical condition, may have led to Lopez opening fire. 
  
 "The immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area," Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, told reporters. 
  
 Some of the soldiers involved in the altercation were victims in the shooting, according to Chris Grey, spokesman for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, who appeared with Milley at a news conference on the sprawling post. 
  
 Officials would not release further details about the argument, saying the investigation was still ongoing into what caused the 34-year-old to set out on a shooting spree that left three soldiers dead and 16 wounded before he killed himself. 
  
 But the sister of one of the soldiers injured in the attack said that prior to the shooting Lopez stopped by the base's personnel office to pick up a form requesting leave -- or military permission to be away for a time. 
  
 Armetra Otis, sister of Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook, said on CNN's "The Lead" that her brother "was at work and a guy came in and asked for a leave form." 
  
 The soldier was told he would have to come back later, Otis said, 
  
 "And apparently I guess he didn't want to hear that, so he came back and just opened fire, " Otis said. 
  
 "He shot the first guy he saw and killed him and then turned the gun on my brother and he was shot four times," she said. Sgt. Westbrook was released from a hospital Friday, his sister said.

 Both Milley and Grey said they did not know if the leave issue in itself led to the altercation. 
  
 "At this time, we have not established a concrete motive," Grey said. 
  
 Investigators have not uncovered any history of criminal convictions or previous criminal activity by Lopez, nor have they found any links to terrorism. 
  
 On Thursday Milley said investigators believed a medical history that indicates an unstable psychiatric or psychological condition may be a "fundamental causal factor," in the shooting. 
  
 But on Friday he said investigators "do not believe" that his "underlying medical conditions ... are the direct precipitating factor" 
  
 The shooting blindsided victims, said Dr. Matthew Davis, medical director of trauma services at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple. 
  
 "It was a shocking episode. It felt very surreal," he said after speaking to victims. "It was a very unexpected thing in the middle of a working day." 
  
 Governor, senator visit 
  
 Texas Gov. Rick Perry and the state's junior U.S. senator visited with some of the wounded Friday. 
  
 Speaking to reporters at Fort Hood afterward, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz hailed the bravery of wounded survivors. He recalled the story of one soldier, shot in the abdomen, who called 911 and "stepped forward" to save others. 
  
 Acknowledging the post has seen two mass shootings since 2009, Perry said there were no easy answers to what happened Wednesday, but that soldiers there will "recover from this latest tragedy." 
  
 "We'll learn lessons about what occurred here and minimize the chances of this ever happening again," Perry said. 
  
 Perry and Cruz declined to answer questions about whether soldiers should be able to carry concealed weapons on base. Right now, Perry said, the focus should be on those who were wounded or killed Wednesday. 
  
 The conditions of three victims, who were previously listed as critical, have been upgraded to fair, Scott & White Memorial Hospital posted on Twitter on Friday morning. 
  
 Five have been discharged from the hospital. Of the four remaining Friday morning, one was expected to go home later in the day, the hospital said. 
  
 Milley announced Friday afternoon that the three soldiers killed will be remembered in a memorial service at the post next Wednesday, exactly one week after the attack. 
  
 The rampage 
  
 The shooting started about 4 p.m. Wednesday when Lopez walked into an administration building at the base and opened fire with his .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol.

 He then got into a car, fired from the vehicle, got out of the car, walked into another nearby administration building and fired again. 
  
 One of the locations was the medical brigade, the other the transportation battalion. Lopez was assigned to the 13th Sustainment Command, which deals with logistics. In his work, he had regular dealings with the transportation battalion. 
  
 But authorities have "no indication at this time" that Lopez was targeting specific soldiers when he opened fire on the Army post, Milley said. 
  
 The base, which has more than 45,000 soldiers and nearly 9,000 civilian employees, went on lockdown after the shooting began. 
  
 A short time later, a military police officer came face to face with Lopez. Both he and she drew their weapons, Milley said. 
  
 Lopez put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, ending his life. 
  
 At Lopez's apartment, his wife was watching news reports about the spree, worrying about her husband, from whom she had not heard all afternoon, said neighbor Xanderia Morris, who tried to console her. 
  
 But Lopez's wife had no idea that he was the shooter until a local TV station identified the dead gunman. His widow became "hysterical" when she heard the news, Morris said. 
  
 Officers picked up Lopez's widow at their apartment near the base in Killeen, and she was cooperating with law enforcement, an FBI official told CNN. 
  
 Depression, anxiety 
  
 Lopez hailed from Puerto Rico, where he served in the National Guard from 1999 until 2010 before moving to the U.S. Army. 
  
 He had two deployments as an infantryman, including a four-month stint in Iraq in 2011 as a truck driver, Milley said. 
  
 Before coming to Fort Hood in February, Lopez served at Fort Bliss in Texas. 
  
 He, his wife and their daughter moved into an apartment a little more than a week before the shooting. 
  
 They appeared to be a normal couple, smiling "whenever they'd see someone," Morris said. 
  
 But behind Lopez's smile lay a history of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, Milley told reporters. The soldier was receiving treatment and taking antidepressants, he said. 
  
 Army records don't show him as having been wounded in Iraq, but Lopez reported that he had suffered a traumatic brain injury, Milley said. 
  
 The shooter "had a clean record" behaviorally, Army Secretary John McHugh said. And he gave no sign during a psychiatric exam last month that he was likely to become violent. 
  
 Lopez had also been prescribed the sedative Ambien, McHugh said. 
  
 Investigators who searched his home have found no significant physical evidence, such as a suicide note, to indicate motive, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday on the condition of anonymity. 
  
 The official also said that Lopez purchased a "large amount" of ammunition when he bought a .45-caliber gun on March 1, and continued to buy more ammunition throughout March. 
  
 U.S. law enforcement officials previously said Lopez bought his gun at Guns Galore, a store in Killeen. 
  
 The casualties 
  
 All those killed in the shooting were military personnel, Milley said. 
  
 Sgt. Timothy Owens was one them, his family said in a prepared statement. 
  
 "He was a very outgoing person and enjoyed Taekwondo," the statement said. "He loved his job in the Army and was going to make it a career." 
  
 Owens, 37, was a counselor in the Army and had served in Iraq. 
  
 His mother, Mary Muntean, told CNN affiliate WICS-TV in Springfield, Illinois: "He was a good person. Why would they shoot a good person that was helping them?" Owens loved the military and planned to make it his career, his mother told the station. 
  
 "He didn't answer the phone so I left a message on his phone: 'Son, call me so I know if you're OK or not.' Well, never got no call from him. I thought: 'Oh God, please don't let it be,'" his mother said. 
  
 Also killed was Staff Sgt. Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, according to his aunt, Benny Rodriguez. 
  
 Lazaney-Rodriguez, 38, planned to retire from the military soon after serving 20 years, Aguadilla Mayor Carlos Mendez told CNN en Español's Mayra Cuevas. 
  
 "It was a very close-knit family," Mendez said "Excellent, decent, very good people. I know his family and his parents. They are good people." 
  
 Sgt. 1st Class Danny Ferguson also was killed, his fiancée, Kristen Haley, told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida. 
  
 Ferguson died trying to hold a door shut to stop the shooter, Haley, also a soldier, told CNN affiliate WTSP-TV in Tampa, Florida. 
  
 "He held that door shut because it wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently they're not," Haley told the station. "If he wasn't the one standing there holding those doors closed, that shooter would have been able to get through and shoot everyone else." 
  
 Haley said Ferguson was a native of Mulberry, Florida, and an outstanding athlete at Mulberry High, where he graduated in 1993. The small town is about 30 miles east of Tampa. 
  
 One or two wounded victims may face long-term disabilities, but doctors are working to prevent this, said Davis, the Scott & White Memorial Hospital medical director of trauma services. 
  
 Not again 
  
 When he first heard about the shooting, Davis says one thought ran through his mind: "How can this possibly happen again?" 
  
 Less than five years ago, the hospital where Davis works treated casualties after Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 32 more in a November 2009 shooting at Fort Hood. 
  
 Hasan was convicted of 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder, and a military jury recommended in August that he be put to death. 
  
 The former military psychiatrist told a court he was on a terrorist mission to protect leading members of the Taliban.
