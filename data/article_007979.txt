A gang armed with sledgehammers broke into Danny Murphy's house in Horley, Surrey, stealing Â£40,000 from a safe.
The 67-year-old taxi driver had doubled his work hours to ensure he would be financially secure during the six-month recovery time following the operation.
Daughter Ilohna Murphy said: "It's like he's lost his whole life. He's saved for 40 years... and now he's given up."
During last Friday's raid, four armed intruders ransacked Mr Murphy's home in Chequers Close while he was out.
They also caused structural damage to the property, and "smashed the internal walls to pieces", Ms Murphy said.
Mr Murphy had his heart operation on Tuesday and is currently recovering in intensive care.
His family have set up a fund to try to raise money for him "so that he can come out knowing that life isn't that bad and he is a little bit secure".
They are also trying to repair his house.
Ms Murphy added: "I'm appealing for anyone with information, or anyone who can support my Dad just to bring him through this hard time.
"Our concern is to get our Dad well and to get him out of this."
Surrey Police said they were investigating the burglary, which happened between 09:45 and 10:15 BST on 23 September.
They said the intruders gained entry to the property via a side gate, and have urged anyone who saw anything suspicious to contact them.
