The 25-year-old netted after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 2-1 friendly win against Saudi Arabian side Al-Batin in Doha, Qatar.
Oscar later won the free-kick from which Lu Wenjun struck the winner.
"I only trained for two days," he said. "This is the start of a new season - we have only one goal, which is to win."

The Chinese Super League gets under way in March.
