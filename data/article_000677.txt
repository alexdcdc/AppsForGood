Villa have lost eight successive matches and are 15 points from safety with five games of the season left.
"They're probably going to be relegated," Black said. "This could very easily implode. It could very easily turn into anarchy.
"I'm going to try and ensure that is not the case."
He added: "If they're all relegated I can only put certain parameters down to ensure that doesn't happen."
Villa will drop out of the top flight for the first time since 1987 if they fail to win at Manchester United on Saturday or if Norwich avoid defeat by Sunderland earlier in the day.
Black has told forward Gabriel Agbonlahor to undergo a personal fitness programme after deeming him unfit. He will not play for at least two weeks.
Black added: "The players are waiting to see what's going to happen here. They're all in limbo.
"They are not great elements to motivate yourself every single day.
"That's my responsibility and I will do my utmost to ensure that it continues to be done on an extremely professional basis."
