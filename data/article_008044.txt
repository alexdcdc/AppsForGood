Michael Crampton, 23, was the keyboard player in The Pisdicables - a ska punk band.
The musician's friend James Montegriffo was also killed in the three-vehicle crash on Eglantine Lane in Farningham early on Saturday.
Eight other people were injured, one seriously.
Mr Crampton's family said: "There are no words to encapsulate the sheer joy and happiness Michael brought to so many.
"A sense of humour, his presence in the room brought a smile to every face," they said in a statement.
"A brilliant young man with great ambition and a great musician, an amazing array of friends and a heart filled to the brim with the deepest love for everyone."'
Police have appealed for anyone who saw a black Vauxhall Insignia with a 61 registration being driven on the A20 towards Swanley to contact them.
A blue Citroen Berlingo van and a white VW Polo were also involved in the collision.
