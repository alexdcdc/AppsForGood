Morgan made his name on the US comedy show, where he was a cast member from 1999 to 2006 before joining 30 Rock.
Former co-stars Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin also joined Morgan on Saturday.
Morgan joked: "People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?' But the truth is, I never did."
He added: "I might actually be a few points higher now."
But he didn't avoid addressing the trauma he had suffered since the crash, which killed his friend and fellow comedian, James McNair.
"It was awful," Morgan said in his opening monologue, "but it also showed me how much love and support I have ... and here I am."
He then performed a 30 Rock sketch with Fey and Baldwin in which his character nearly dies.
Morgan played Tracy Jordan in Fey's popular US sitcom, which ran from 2006 to 2013.
The star was later joined on stage by his wife Megan Wollover and their baby daughter.
Morgan was left in a coma for two weeks, with a traumatic head injury, a broken leg, nose and ribs, after a Walmart lorry crashed into the back of his limousine in June 2014.
McNair had also been a passenger in the limo.
In August, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Walmart employee Kevin Roper, the driver of the lorry, could have prevented the crash had he been driving at the posted speed limit.
Investigators found that Mr Roper's truck was driving 65 mph in a 45 mph zone.
The NTSB said he had been awake for 28 hours at the time of the crash.
They also said the injuries to Morgan and other passengers were exacerbated by their failure to wear seat belts.
Mr Roper has been charged with vehicular homicide and assault by auto and is awaiting trial in New Jersey.
Morgan reached an "amicable" settlement with Walmart in May, the terms of which have not been made public.
