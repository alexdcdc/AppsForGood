Forty-eight people died in the fire in Dublin on St Valentine's Day.
The police action follows a complaint made by a researcher concerning evidence that five of the victims were already dead before the alarm was raised about a fire in the seating area.
A Garda spokesperson said they could not comment on the new file.
