The body of a 27-year-old man was discovered at a property in Blyth on Tuesday.
The next day, a man aged 35 was found dead at a separate address in the town.
Northumbria Police said it was treating both deaths as isolated incidents, but they were believed to be drug related and heroin currently in circulation in the area could be a factor.
A force spokesman said: "Officers are carrying out inquiries to identify the source of the drugs in order to take action against those supplying these substances, but it is vitally important that any heroin users understand the real risks they face.
"Taking any illegal drug is dangerous and potentially life threatening and I'd urge anyone who feels unwell to seek medical treatment immediately."
