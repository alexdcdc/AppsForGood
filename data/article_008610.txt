A "blustery weekend" is expected with westerly and south-westerly winds of up to 60mph (97km/h) hitting on the coast on Saturday, the Met Office said.
Saturday's Irish Ferries fast craft sailings from Anglesey have been cancelled, and a speed limit is in force on the A55 Britannia Bridge.
Gusts around western coasts could reach 70mph (113km/h) on Sunday.
Irish Ferries said adverse conditions for Sunday also mean its Rosslare-Pembroke ferry crossing are "in doubt", and passengers are advised to check with the operator before travelling.
Highways officials say the A477 Cleddau Bridge at Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, has been closed to high-sided vehicles due to the wind.
The Met Office warning runs until 18:00 on Sunday, with further yellow alerts issued for rain on Monday 30 November, and on 1 December.
