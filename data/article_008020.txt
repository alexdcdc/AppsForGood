Emergency services were called to Jasmine Crescent in Princes Risborough just after 00:30 on Monday morning.
Thames Valley Police said it believed the male occupant of the house had died but that formal identification was yet to take place.
An investigation has begun into the cause of the fire but the circumstances are not being treated as suspicious.
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: "The next of kin of the man who lived at the house have been informed and our thoughts remain with them at this time."
Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said about 20 firefighters were called to the property which was left "severely damaged".
Fire Service Commander, Andy Jones, said: "The fire started in the front bedroom.
"Firefighters were confronted with a well developed fire with flames issuing out from the windows at the rear of the property.
"The flames were actually coming out of the roof space itself.
"Nobody noticed the fire for some time so it had obviously been burning for over an hour before the first call went into the fire service.
He added that the fire left the upper floor of the property unstable and that specialist crews had to "shore up" the building to make it safe for fire investigators to enter.
A drone fitted with a camera was initially flown over the building to inspect the damage.
