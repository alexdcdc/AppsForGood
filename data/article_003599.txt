A three-mile (4.8km) stretch of the A591 between Dunmail Raise, north of Grasmere and Thirlmere, was closed after the December storm.
It is expected to reopen in May.
Liberal Democrat leader and MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale Tim Farron, said the local economy was losing up to Â£1m each day the route remained closed.
Highways England said "good progress" was being maintained despite "difficult working conditions and unpredictable weather".
A 106m (347ft) retaining wall is being constructed alongside the road, after steel supporting posts were installed last month.
The agency said stonemasons were putting local stone reclaimed from the flood debris along the wall to cover the concrete, to ensure it blends in with the surroundings.
The wall will provide greater protection to the road from the effects of erosion, the agency said.
