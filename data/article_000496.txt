The members say they'll continue as a four-piece after Zayn Malik announced he was leaving the group last week to "live like a normal 22-year-old".
His departure was followed by rumours on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook that One Direction was about to break up.
But Liam Payne thanked fans for sticking with the band and for "not thinking it's finished".
He tweeted: "I can see a lot of people thanking us for staying but your the real Heros here thanks for not thinking it's finished."
The band continued their On the Road Again tour and have been playing concerts in South Africa.
They start the European leg of the tour by playing Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 5 and 6 June.
Zayn Malik quit the group last week after flying back to the UK, having been "signed off with stress".
It was after reports that he'd cheated on his 21-year-old fiancee, Perrie Edwards.
He told The Sun that he was "upset" for the group's fans and he said there was no bad blood between him and his former bandmates, who he said had been "really supportive".
It's thought he's working on a solo album with producer Naughty Boy, who's worked on tracks for Emeli Sande, Cheryl Cole and Leona Lewis.
