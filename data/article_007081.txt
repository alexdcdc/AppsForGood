His family said they have "lost a beautiful soul".
Mr Colwell died from a single shot gun wound to the head, a post-mortem examination revealed.
A family statement, released through a police family liaison officer, said he will be "sadly missed by his mother, father, family and many friends".
"He left college last summer and went up north to work as a boy and came back a fine young man," it added.
Mr Colwell, from Capel Uchaf ,near Clynnog Fawr, was found at the Ship Inn in Llanbedrog on 5 February.
Four men have been bailed after a shotgun was recovered from the scene.
