Carmarthenshire council voted in January to drop the English stream at Ysgol Llangennech, near Llanelli.
A Labour councillor called the decision "segregation" - while a Welsh-medium education campaigner suggested parents could "cross the border".
Mr Jones said it is important "toxicity" in the debate is reduced.
At First Minister's Questions, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood claimed some Labour members had been working with UKIP to undermine the changes, which she said were in keeping with the Welsh Government's own policy on promoting the Welsh language.
Mr Jones replied: "There are some comments that have been made by politicians that I do not agree with.
"I've seen those comments and I think it's hugely important now that calm prevails, and the toxicity we last saw some years ago is now reduced."
It was for the Plaid Cymru-run administration of Carmarthenshire council to explain the decisions it had made in Llangennech, he said.
Mr Jones said the Welsh Government was committed to its "quest" of hitting a target of 1m Welsh speakers.
