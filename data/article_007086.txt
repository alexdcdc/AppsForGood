Courtney Mark Johnson struck the on-duty officer while leaving a building site in Loughborough.
Leicester Crown Court heard he "revved his engine" and ploughed past the officer, hitting his leg and causing serious injuries.
Johnson, 34, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent to resist arrest and two counts of theft. He was jailed for three years and nine months.
The defendant, of Armadale Drive, Leicester, was also banned from driving for three years and four months.
Judge Philip Head described his actions as "grossly reckless".
He added: "You've demonstrated you're a menace - next time it could be manslaughter or it could be murder."
The officer was responding to reports of a burglary when he was struck by Johnson's vehicle on Hillcrest Drive on 14 August 2016.
Leicestershire Police said the defendant drove out of Allendale Road in a Transit flatbed van, "ramming the fencing as he left" before crashing into a parked vehicle.
The officer saw Johnson stationary at some traffic lights and walked towards him, at which point the driver "revved his engine and drove at the officer".
Det Con Chris Fox said it was a "horrific incident" which would "stay with [the victim] forever".
Assistant Chief Constable Phil Kay, added: "He could have potentially lost his life that day.
"Officers take risks every day in order to protect the public, but that doesn't mean that it's right that they are subjected to such violence."
