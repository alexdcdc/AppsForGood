Judges scored four restaurants selected to represent each town or city, assessing hygiene ratings and public votes.
The West Yorkshire city was praised for holding several curry-themed events, including a poppadom-eating challenge.
Glasgow finished second and Brighton came in third in the competition, which marks the end of National Curry Week.
Leicester and Birmingham finished fourth and fifth respectively.
The restaurants selected to represent Bradford were Aakash, Kiplings, Shimla Spice and Akbar's.
Patricia Tillotson, of Visit Bradford, said: "Winning the hotly-contested competition this many times in a row has never been done before.
"Our entry has created a real sense of community cohesion, which ultimately is what the Curry Capital of Britain competition is all about."
