Thomas has been replaced by The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright just days before Sunday's finale.
He had been set to battle it out with Olympic gymnast Louis Smith, Paralympic medallist Kadeena Cox, and Emma Parker Bowles to be crowned champion of the winter sports competition.
The 42-year-old is the fourth celebrity to withdraw from this year's series.
Model Caprice suffered an illness, Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins broke his leg and Vogue Williams pulled out before an episode even aired.
A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: "Gareth Thomas has withdrawn due to personal reasons."
Bright replaces Thomas as she was the last to be eliminated.
