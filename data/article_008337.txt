He also pleaded guilty to two counts of forcing a person to carry out forced labour and three counts of fraud.
Joyce was jailed for a total of five years and 10 months by a judge at Oxford Crown Court.
He was also made subject to a restraining order and a slavery and trafficking prevention order, both of which will not have time limits.
Det Ch Insp Mark Glover, from Thames Valley Police's major crime unit, said it had been "a long and complex investigation".
