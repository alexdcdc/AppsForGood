The Football Association charge of violent conduct, which Costa denied, related to an incident during Tuesday's League Cup semi-final second leg.
"The main thing is when I get home I can go to sleep knowing that I've not done anything wrong," Costa, 26, told national newspapers.
"I never meant to do that and it was not on purpose."
Costa missed Saturday's 1-1 draw with second placed Manchester City and will also sit out league games at Aston Villa on 7 February and Everton four days later.
The Spain international says he "accepts and respects" the punishment, but stresses he did not set out to hurt his opponent.
"It is a suspension. I have to accept that, I have to take it," he added.
"Obviously I feel sad because I'm not going to be able to help the team to play.
"I'm not saying I'm an angel. I'm no angel. You can see that. But every time I play I will play the same way because that's the way I am.
"That's what I need to do in order to support my family. That's my bread and butter.
"Also, that's what I need to do for this club and for the fans of this club, for the supporters and for all the people involved in this club."
Costa has scored 17 goals in 19 top-flight games since joining from Atletico Madrid last summer to help Chelsea establish a five point lead at the top of the Premier League .
"I'm a different guy off the pitch, as you can see, but on the pitch I will not change," added Costa."
