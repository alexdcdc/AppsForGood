 In an interview with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on Tuesday, Aug. 12, Kardashian, 33, said North has mastered her own signature pose. 
  
 "Every time there is a camera out and paparazziâ€¦she does this either mean angry Kanye face or a pose," the E! reality star said, laughing. "She'll be cracking up and then the second the camera comes on she [makes the pose.]"
