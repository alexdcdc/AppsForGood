Foley joined Charlton on a short-term deal in August, when City boss Russell Slade was in charge of the Addicks.
The 32-year-old made 20 appearances for the club, but his contract was not renewed when it expired on 5 January.
"Kevin is a top professional and will be a calming and mature influence on the rest of the squad," Slade said.
"I'm pleased to have such an experienced player join the football club."
