An interesting historical fashion footnote: Thom Browne criticized President Obama’s wardrobe in a 2010 WSJ magazine interview. He said in the interview: 
  
 “Obama could be dressed so much better. It looks like his clothing just doesn’t fit him. What is he doing? He’s a politician. My brother is a politician, and unfortunately they are too concerned that their constituents will not appreciate them looking better than everyone else. As opposed to thinking, “I should dress well because that’s what people want to see.” I saw a documentary on the Queen Mum during the war and she still dressed to go out and see the people because they expected it. They wanted to see a queen. They didn’t want to see her looking like them.” ||||| In 2009 Chief Justice John Roberts flipped some very important words in President Obama's swearing-in. Four years later, it appears the two still haven't figured out how to do get this tradition quite right. Here's the big "oops" moment from today's inauguration:

 And here's a freeze-frame: 
  
 Four years ago, if you recall, it was Justice Roberts messing up the oath. And all that official practicing on Sunday seems for naught. It won't help much now, but here's how the oath of office supposed to go: 
  
 I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
