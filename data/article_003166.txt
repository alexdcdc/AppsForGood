Dora Linda Nishihara, 69, who worked as a courthouse bailiff, died after her car fell into the 12ft (3.6m) hole filled with water.
Her car was retrieved from the sinkhole by a crane on Monday, a day after it first appeared.
A second vehicle also fell into the hole and two other people were hurt.
The driver of the second vehicle was rescued by a witness, local media reported, but Ms Nishihara's vehicle had flipped on to its roof and was completely submerged.
The flow of water in the sinkhole was caused by a ruptured sewer line, local media reported.
Bexar County Sheriff Susan Pamerleau said her department was "heartbroken" and was assisting the family.
