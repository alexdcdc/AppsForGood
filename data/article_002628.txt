Polls open at 07:00 BST at more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, with counting starting once voting ends at 22:00 BST.
A total of 650 Westminster MPs will be elected, with about 46.9 million people registered to vote.

Some votes have already been cast, through postal voting, which accounted for 16.4% of the total electorate at the 2015 general election.
Overall turnout in 2015, when the Conservatives won 331 out of 650 seats, was 66.4%, up from 2010.
