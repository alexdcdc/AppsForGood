 Get this ..."60 Minutes" did its interview withwithout ever contacting-- to get her take on the things he said in his autobiography ... and she's not happy about it.Sources very familiar with the situation tell TMZ ... a "60 Minute" producer made calls Monday to friends of Maria -- AFTER Arnold's interview was shot -- to see if she had a general comment about the book ... but the producer never gave specifics about what Arnold said in the interview or the book. We're told the piece was already in the can, and Maria had "no interest" in commenting -- especially because it's ridiculous to wedge a comment of hers in a long piece.One source says, "The piece is a blow *** for Arnold. Lesley Stahl just fawned over him," adding it was no surprise Maria's point of view was never solicited before Stahl sat down with Arnold.As we first reported, Arnold never offered an advance copy of the book to Maria. A close friend of hers tells TMZ, "She knows the book is a big PR stunt to get back in the public's good graces."As for whether Maria will read the book, we're told she has no burning desire One of Maria's friends told us, "What Maria has already been through ... nothing surprises her anymore." ||||| 3:12 November 17, 2012
