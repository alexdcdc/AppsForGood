A first-ever success at the ABAX Stadium moved Uwe Rosler's men to within four points of second-placed Bolton, who have a game in hand and face Oldham Athletic on Saturday.
Fleetwood took command in a first half they dominated, former Peterborough man David Ball laying on a simple 24th-minute opener for Bobby Grant before Ashley Eastham was left with a similarly easy finish three minutes from half-time after fine work from George Glendon following a quickly-taken corner.
It took hosts Posh an hour to pose any sort of attacking threat on a day where their last mathematical hope of making the play-offs disappeared.
Craig Mackail-Smith saw a penalty shout ignored after being clattered by Alex Cairns, but he fired past the Fleetwood keeper to halve his side's arrears in the 68th minute.
Mackail-Smith tapped home following a brilliant burst and low delivery from the left by Marcus Maddison.
And the striker came closest to snatching a draw when heading a Michael Smith cross straight at Cairns with seven minutes to go.
