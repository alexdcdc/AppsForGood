At its height, eight fire engines, two aerial appliances and two water bowsers tackled the blaze at M&P Motorcycles in Gorseinon.
Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service left the scene at 2200 BST Sunday after being called out just before midnight on Saturday.
Two officers are visiting the scene on Monday to begin their investigation.
Alan Davies, a witness who lives nearby, said three-quarters of the building was already well alight shortly after midnight.
Steve Bryant, the fire officer in charge, said it developed very quickly and crews worked hard to safely bring it under control and protect nearby properties.
"We have spent all night dealing with this incident and the investigation into the cause of the fire will commence later today," he said.
Mr Davies said: "I came home at about 12.15 (on Sunday morning) and I could see the blaze.
"By the time I got there three-quarters of the building was well alight - all except for the office block.
"The office block was the last thing to go.
"They were trying to prevent the fire from going to the furniture place next door, and managed to."
The fire is only a couple of miles from the serious tyre blaze in the old Mettoys factory in Fforestfach, which has been going since 16 June and is not expected to be put out until next month.
That earlier fire produced a lot of smoke, and Mr Davies said the latest one had also done so.
M&P's website describes itself as "Europe's largest motorcycle parts and accessories company".
Mr Davies said the building was normally "like a pilgrimage" for motorcyclists, and some were turning up on Sunday morning, unaware of the fire.
