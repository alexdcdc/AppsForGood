Satnam Singh, 74, was found on Coronation Street, Derby in July 2015. Police originally thought he had been hit by a car.
Further investigations revealed Mr Singh had, in fact, been assaulted, Derbyshire Police said.
Sukhraj Atwal, of Pear Tree Crescent, Derby, appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Saturday.
Mr Singh was found injured on a Friday morning, near the Sikh temple where he worked as a volunteer.
