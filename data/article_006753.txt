 Dubost, a web product manager currently based in Paris, is looking to travel for his next position. So he decided to make his CV stand out anywhere in the world — by mimicking an Amazon product page. 
  
 The result, "Philippe's Amaz'ing Resume," is a pitch-perfect pastiche. Suggesting that you add the applicant to your shopping cart to see his price is such a clever way of asking to be hired, we're amazed no one thought of it before. Especially when followed by the urgent reminder: "only 1 left in stock. Order soon!" 
  
 You can see the full resume here. But in case Dubost's site has been overwhelmed by traffic — he's already had to change his web hosting service once, according to his Twitter feed — here's another screenshot. 
  
 Dubost has taken pains to replicate every last aspect of an Amazon page — even inserting an ad. We've seen resumes that look like Facebook pages and Twitter feeds before, but none have this much attention to detail. 
  
 And given the fact that hiring is a transaction, making it look like the world's largest store makes a ton of sense.
