It was drawn up following the death of 16-year-old Bailey Gwynne, who was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy.
Staff will be provided with clarity on the recording of incidents in schools, pupil searches and when and how to confiscate weapons, including knives.
The schoolboy's killer is serving nine years for culpable homicide.
An independent review into the death of Bailey in October last year found his death was "potentially avoidable" if teachers had known his attacker carried a knife.
The review, conducted by child welfare professional Andrew Lowe, made 21 recommendations.
Other actions approved by the council include providing professional learning opportunities to teachers in order that they can deliver anti-weapon and knife crime lessons.
Gayle Gorman, director of education and children's services, said: "The report before committee outlined and demonstrated Aberdeen City Council and our partners clear commitment to implement the recommendations of the review - and indeed to go further to ensure that our children, young people, families, communities and staff are as informed as they can be regarding the tragic and devastating consequences of carrying weapons.
"I know that no strategy, or indeed case review, will alter the fact that Bailey is no longer with us and that his loss is keenly felt by all who knew and loved him.
"As always my thoughts are with Bailey's family."
