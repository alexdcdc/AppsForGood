Cardiff's 6-2 away win over Sheffield Steelers means the Devils cannot be caught in the title race.
Colin Shields netted twice with Chris Higgins, David Rutherford and Mike Forney also on target for the Giants in Saturday's game at the SSE Arena.
Saturday's win came after Friday's 5-2 home defeat by Sheffield.
That left the second-placed Giants five points behind the Devils, with Belfast only having three matches left and Cardiff also having a match in hand on Derrick Walser's side.
Belfast will complete their league season with two away games against the new champions next weekend before the campaign concludes with the play-offs competition.
