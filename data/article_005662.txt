Joseph Jakubowski, 32, was found camping on a farm in southern Wisconsin and taken into custody early on Friday, police say.
Police feared that he was planning an attack after he allegedly broke into a gun store and made off with 18 weapons.
The governor had cancelled the state's Easter event, due to safety concerns.
But after the news of his detention, Governor Scott Walker reinstated the Easter Egg Hunt.
The manhunt began on 4 April in Janesville, Wisconsin - about 70 miles southwest of Milwaukee - after the suspect allegedly broke into the Armageddon Supplies gun shop and stole the guns and two silencers.
His burned-out car was found nearby soon after.
During the search, a mobile phone video was posted online claiming to show Jakubowski mailing a 161-page conspiracy-laced manifesto to the White House.
The manifesto, which was obtained by WTMJ-TV, features lines such as: "Revolution. It's time for change."
In the document, he writes that he is not afraid to die and that: "I choose my death to be carried out by the hands of the president! The leader of the people! Not in secret either! On live TV."
He also made threats against religious institutions, officials say, causing places of worship and schools to increase their security during the search.
He has so far been charged with three serious crimes.
