Traffic management measures will affect both north and southbound lanes between Junction 4 at Maryville and Junction 5 at Raith for about eight days.
The stretch between Bothwell and Uddingston will be reduced from three lanes to two in each direction.
The closure of lane three is to allow crossover points to be built between the north and south carriageways.
This will allow M74 traffic to travel in contraflow while overhead gantries are removed.
Their removal will enable the carriageway to be widened by an extra lane in both directions.
Access to Junction 4 and Junction 5 will be maintained, although delays are expected.
The work is being undertaken as part of the Â£500m M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements Project.
Project manager Graeme Reid said: "These works are taking place concurrently with several other major traffic management schemes, including the M73 between Maryville and Baillieston and Raith, Junction 5.
"We are advising motorists to refer to the Transport Scotland and Traffic Scotland websites for live traffic updates and to plan their journeys in advance."
When complete, the motorway improvements project is expected to significantly reduce congestion across the central Scotland motorway network.
