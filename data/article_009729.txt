After spending almost a week on the Italian coast guard ship Diciotti, 27 migrant children were on Thursday allowed to disembark from the vessel at the Sicilian port of Catania, Italian news agencies reported. 
  
 Aid organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it had finally met the children; the Italian Interior Ministry said they were all between 14 and 16 years old. A delegation from Italy's guarantor of personal rights office also boarded the ship.

 Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini had said on Wednesday that he would allow children to leave the rescue ship, but refused to let the remaining 150 migrants on board off the vessel. 
  
 "If there are children on board, they can get off now," Salvini said in a Facebook video. "For the others ... nobody gets off," he added, while challenging Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte or President Sergio Mattarella to overrule his decision. 
  
 The Diciotti was given permission to dock at Catania after a standoff with Malta, which refused to let the vessel dock at its port.

 Investigation reportedly underway 
  
 Italy's commissioner for the rights of detainees, Mauro Palma, said that the migrants are "de facto deprived of freedom without any legal basis or judicial oversight," and announced an inspection on the Ubaldo Diciotti would take place on Thursday. 
  
 Italian media reports also said the Sicilian public prosecutor was investigating an unknown person for illegal imprisonment. 
  
 Salvini, who heads Italy's right-wing Lega party, responded to the reports on Twitter, saying the unknown person was no stranger and it was in fact him. 
  
 "No one unknown, investigate me!" Salvini tweeted. "I am the one who does not want more illegal immigrants to land in Italy." 
  
 Salvini demands EU help 
  
 Salvini has requested that other European Union countries step up and take in the remaining migrants. Germany is among those who received a request, but the German government has yet to make a decision. 
  
 The Interior Ministry in Rome said that the European Commission has called a meeting to discuss the issue on Friday. 
  
 The new populist coalition government in Rome has refused to let a number of migrant ships dock in Italy since it took office in June. 
  
 Salvini has said he wants to send the migrants back to Libya, the main departure point for boats often filled beyond capacity with asylum-seekers headed for Europe.

 No arancini were allowed onto the Diciotti, the Italian coastguard ship that has been docked in Catania since Monday night with around 150 people on board, whom the Italian government has refused permission to disembark. 
  
 Interior Minister Matteo Salvini argues that those rescued at sea are illegal immigrants, not refugees, and has threatened to have them taken to Libya unless other EU countries offer to take them in.

 The arancini demonstration was called to show that some in the local community would like Catania to be an "open port" for these and other migrants, according to organizer Silvio Laviano. He described his message as: "Welcome to Catania! Here, have an arancino." 
  
 Why arancini? The Sicilian speciality represents not only a snack to be eaten while travelling but something to offer hungry visitors, participants said. 
  
 "For us in Sicily, food has always been the way you welcome guests," one woman explained. 
  
 While some 30 minors on board the Diciotti were allowed to disembark on Wednesday night, Salvini has so far resisted calls to allow the rest of the group to land. 
  
 "I'm not backing down," he insisted on Thursday, calling on the EU to intervene. 
  
 The United Nations refugee agency, as well as aid organizations, have expressed concerns over the migrants' continued detention on the ship, a week since they were rescued at sea near the Italian island of Lampedusa. 
  
 Pro-migrant protesters have been arriving at Catania port since the Diciotti docked there late on Monday. On Thursday, one group attempted to reach the coastguard ship in a dinghy, but was intercepted by police.

  ||||| The EU has hit back at a threat by Italy’s populist government to halt its budget payments to Brussels amid a row over a rescue ship carrying refugees and migrants, as prosecutors from Sicily travel to Rome to question officials, including the far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, about the illegal detention of those onboard. 
  
 The investigation, conducted by the prosecutor of Agrigento, was launched against “unknowns”. Sources said Salvini risked coming under investigation because he was responsible for the disembarkation ban. Although prosecutors refused to confirm it officially, sources told the Guardian Salvini would be questioned at some point in the next few days. 
  
  
  
 Italy is facing a violation of the article 5 of the European convention on human rights. Under its terms, asylum seekers detained for more than 48 hours should be immediately released and should be given the opportunity to apply for a refugee status. 
  
 On Friday, the 150 migrants onboard the Diciotti started a hunger strike to protest against Salvini’s decision not to disembark them. 
  
 On Thursday, the Italian deputy prime minister threatened to suspend his country’s financial contribution to the EU if Brussels did not intervene and redistribute the 150 people onboard the coastguard ship Ubaldo Diciotti. 
  
 Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S), which governs in coalition with the far-right League, said if the EU did not act immediately his party would not be willing to give €20bn each year to the bloc.

 The European commission said threats were unhelpful and called on all countries to find a solution to help the people onboard. 
  
 “Let’s not engage in finger-pointing,” said a commission spokesman, Alexander Winterstein, when asked about the comments. “Unconstructive comments, let alone threats, are not helpful, and they will not get us any closer to a solution. The European Union is a community of rules and it operates on the basis of rules, not threats. So we would call on all parties involved to find a swift solution for the persons onboard in the spirit of good cooperation.” 
  
 The 150 people onboard the vessel have gone on hunger strike, having been prevented from disembarking since Monday. 
  
 On Thursday, Di Mario said: “We have had enough, Europe must strike a blow. If tomorrow they do not make a decision about the Diciotti and the redistribution of migrants, M5S and I will suspend the funding.” 
  
 Along with Germany, France and the UK, Italy is one of the net payers to the EU budget, which pays for common policies, such as farm payments, infrastructure projects and running the bloc. Italy’s net contribution was €2.3bn in 2017. 
  
 The EU budget pays for common policies, such as farm payments, infrastructure projects and running the EU. Member states pay their membership dues monthly, giving Di Maio an imminent opportunity to flex his political muscles. But Italy would jeopardise the payments it receives, which totalled €10bn in 2017 and almost €12bn in 2016, if it makes good on its threat. The country was granted a further €9m in recent days to help it cope with the numbers of refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean. 
  
 The commission, which is the guardian of EU law and can take recalcitrant governments to the European court of justice, declined to comment on the consequences if the Italian government refused to pay its dues. 
  
  
  
 The sharp exchange highlighted the stalemate over which country will help the people onboard the Diciotti. Senior officials from 12 member states were holding emergency talks in Brussels on Friday. The commission said the meeting was not organised to find an immediate solution, but to find a long-term answer to the migration crisis. 
  
 “What we are looking for is a structural, sustainable solution, moving away from this ship-by ship troubleshooting,” said Winterstein. 
  
 EU leaders agreed in testy, all-night talks in June to create special “controlled centres” to process the asylum claims of people rescued from the Mediterranean. But the agreement appears merely to have papered over divisions and no country has agreed to set up a centre on its soil. 
  
 The Diciotti rescued 190 people from an overcrowded boat about 19.5 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa on 15 August. Thirteen of them were evacuated for emergency medical treatment. 
  
 Rome insisted Malta should take in the group because the boat first passed through the country’s search-and-rescue area, but Valletta refused, claiming the people wanted to reach Italy. 
  
 On Monday afternoon, Italy’s transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, tweeted: “The Diciotti ship will dock in Catania.” 
  
 But shortly afterwards Salvini’s press officer said the interior minister had not given, and would not give authorisation for the 177 refugees and migrants to disembark until he was assured that all would “go elsewhere”. 
  
 On Wednesday afternoon, prosecutors in Agrigento visited the ship and questioned the captain and several of its passengers. 
  
 “I heard that the prosecutor’s office in Agrigento has opened an investigation,” Salvini said in a video on Facebook Live. “I also heard that the suspects are ‘unknown’ at the moment. But I’m not unknown. My name is Matteo Salvini, I’m the minister of the interior. Come on, try me too, I’m here.” 
  
 Salvini authorised on Wednesday night for the 27 unaccompanied minors to disembark after he was visited by magistrates, but madeclear he would not allow the remaining 150 onboard to also do so unless “Europe stepped in”. 
  
 “They need assistance as soon a possible,” Giovanna Di Benedetto, a spokeswoman for Save the Children, told the Guardian. “Some of them have suffered several months, if not over a year, of imprisonment in Libya’s detention camps. 
  
  
  
 “One of them had vision problems and his pupils were dilated, said Nathalie Leiba, a psychologist for Médecins Sans Frontières. “He told me that he was harassed by the Libyans who forced him to call his family to send them money.” ||||| CASTELBUONO, Sicily (CN) — A high-stakes legal and political drama is unfolding at the Sicilian port of Catania, where about 150 asylum-seekers rescued from the Mediterranean Sea were being kept aboard an Italian coast guard vessel on Friday — the fifth day they were blocked from setting foot in Italy. 
  
 Human rights lawyers charged that Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, a popular but divisive hardline anti-immigrant politician, was breaking Italian and international laws by ordering the asylum-seekers kept aboard the vessel, the Diciotti. 
  
 Salvini has vowed to stop people fleeing poverty and war in Africa and Asia from entering Italy. He’s also promised to deport a half million migrants from Italy. Since taking office in June, he has blocked humanitarian ships from bringing people rescued from the sea to Italy. 
  
 The Diciotti case, though, is forcing Europe into uncharted legal waters, and many legal experts say the Italian government is on the wrong side of the law. 
  
 “This is new,�? said Gianluca Vitale, an attorney who handles immigration cases, in a telephone interview. “The democratic system is in play.�? 
  
 He called the case a critical legal test. 
  
 “There are no uncertainties as far as the law is concerned,�? Vitale said. “As far as I am concerned, inhumane treatment is happening right now.�? 
  
 Salvini is not backing down. He even threatened to send the immigrants aboard the Diciotti back to Libya, a country where immigrants are known to be tortured and badly mistreated. 
  
 Humanitarian organizations warned that Salvini’s hardline policy against immigrants could lead to more deaths at sea by slowing rescue operations. More than 1,500 people have died this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. 
  
 Salvini’s stances, though, are popular with many Italians. 
  
 Human rights attorneys say the detention aboard the vessel is a violation of the immigrants’ rights to freedom and even constitutes a form of torture. They say the detention also violates international laws protecting refugees. 
  
 Many of the immigrants aboard the Diciotti are Eritrean. Twenty-seven children were allowed off the vessel Thursday. Some of those still aboard suffer from scabies, an Italian prosecutor said. 
  
 Sicilian prosecutors said they were looking into whether any laws had been violated. 
  
 Defiantly, Salvini blasted his critics, including Italian President Sergio Mattarella. The president wants the asylum-seekers to be allowed to disembark. 
  
 “If someone wants to investigate me, go ahead and investigate me,�? Mattarella said on Twitter, a medium he relies on to get his political messages out. “I’m ready to explain my reasons.�? 
  
 In response to this new flashpoint on immigration, European envoys huddled Friday in Brussels to discuss what to do. Italian media reported no breakthroughs were reached. 
  
 Italy’s new government is demanding that other European nations take in immigrants aboard the vessel. Italy complains it’s been abandoned by Europe in dealing with tens of thousands of immigrants and refugees crossing the Mediterranean. 
  
 On Friday, Belgian and Hungarian officials said they were unwilling to take in immigrants from the Diciotti, La Repubblica newspaper reported. 
  
 The Italian government has even threatened to stop payments it makes to the EU unless it gets its way with the immigrants aboard the Diciotti . 
  
 That threat was made by Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the 5-Star Movement, an anti-establishment party that formed a coalition government with Salvini’s right-wing nationalist League party. 
  
 In an interview on an Italian radio show, Salvini said that the people picked up by the Diciotti were illegal immigrants with no right to be in Italy. He doubted they were fleeing war. 
  
 “This morning 160,000 people are waking up in Italian hotels and getting breakfast paid for by Italians,�? he said, referring to thousands of asylum-seekers in Italy whose pleas for asylum are being handled by Italian authorities. 
  
 Salvini also claims that immigrants and refugees are fueling a system of human trafficking that allows smugglers to purchase weapons and drugs. He said he wants to follow the example of Australia, which has a policy of stopping immigrants from reaching Australia. Australia sends people back to where they left from or to centers outside of Australia. 
  
 “No one who is rescued in the middle of the sea is allowed to put foot on Australian soil,�? Salvini said in the interview. “This is what I want to get to.�? 
  
 “I’m not afraid of anything. I have a clean conscience,�? he said of the potential of being charged. 
  
 Vitale, the immigration lawyer, said that Salvini may have committed an abuse of power by closing the port to the ship. He said such an authority rests with the minister of infrastructure. He also said the coast guard captain of the Diciotti may face charges for carrying out an illegal order.
