Keeper Roy Carroll's clearance cannoned off Bobson Bawling for debutant Rhys Murphy to roll the visitors in front.
Notts levelled when Edwards headed in after a throw-in, and a minute later Noble lashed in to the top corner.
Noble then converted a penalty after Izale McLeod was fouled and another Edwards header sealed Crawley's fate.
The winning margin could have been even greater but McLeod, against the club he left to join County in August, was denied by Freddie Woodman, while Graeme Burke's long-range strike was also well saved by the visiting keeper.
The closest the Red Devils came to hitting back was when Carroll was alert to palm away Sonny Bradley's close-range header.
Notts move up to 16th place as a result of their second home win of the season, while Crawley slip into the bottom two with the same goal difference as Dagenham in 22nd, but having scored a goal less.
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"I am massively frustrated and massively disappointed for the supporters who made trek up and were supporting us at home.
"We started the game well, got the ball down and played with real threats and perhaps could've done better with the chances we had.
"We decided to press the self destruct button and not deal with things and make poor clearances and all of a sudden, within a minute, we were 2-1 down.
