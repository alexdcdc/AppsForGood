Ross Hannah's 19th goal of the season from close range put the home side ahead, but the lead did not last.
After half-time Williams broke through the defence and curled past goalkeeper Tony Thompson to equalise.
With five minutes remaining the forward then lashed in a wonderful low strike from 25 yards to seal the points.
