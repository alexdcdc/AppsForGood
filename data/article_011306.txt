Troon is the only club on the Open rota to have a male-only membership policy.
A majority is needed to remove the ban, with the club reporting in June that "over three quarters of the members" supported admitting female members.
Muirfield still has a ban on female members and has been told by the governing body they cannot stage another Open until it is removed.
That left Troon as the only club on the Open that has men-only membership after Royal St George's, which hosted the Open in 2011, voted last year to end its 128-year ban on female members.
The club consulted members in May over the its men-only policy but brought forward a vote on the issue following Muirfield's ban.
Muirfield said in June it wanted to hold a fresh ballot on admitting female members before the end of the year.
The 145th Open Championship will begin on 14 July.
