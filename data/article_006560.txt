All babies in the UK are to be offered a potentially life-saving vaccine against meningitis B from the autumn.
Guernsey States said it "intends" to introduce a Men B immunisation programme but has not set a date.
The mother of a boy who died from the disease said she wants the vaccination brought in "as soon as possible".
Gill Roe, whose son Toby died aged 17 in 2000, said the vaccination was "hugely important" and called for parity with the UK.
She said: "The health of the islanders and the wellbeing of everybody is probably one of the most important things."
Adrian Robson from the Meningitis Research Foundation said it was "disappointing" people in Guernsey would not have "the same degree of protection against this deadly disease".
A spokesperson for the Health and Social Services Department said the board had "agreed that it intends to implement a local Meningitis B immunisation programme".
"The final decision will be made once the price of the vaccine for local supplies is available," the spokesperson added.
