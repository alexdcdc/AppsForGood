Graham Clarke was found injured in Heywood, Manchester, on 5 April. He died later in hospital.
James Clarke, 34, of no fixed address, was jailed for 10 years after being found guilty of manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court.
The 52-year-old victim had accused his son of stealing his mobility scooter and the pair argued, police said.
Mr Clarke's family said: "Graham was taken from us in April in completely unnecessary circumstances.
"We cannot express how devastated we are that his life has been stolen and for this to have happened at the hands of his own son makes this particularly distressing for our family.
"We will never forget Graham or the many memories he has given us. Graham is now at peace and we have laid him to rest with his daughter Rachel."
Senior Investigating Officer Bob Tonge said: "This was a horrific and deeply personal attack that Clarke carried out on his own flesh and blood.
"Clarke has shown absolutely no remorse for causing the death of his own father, who he believed in his mind to be to blame for the deaths of his mother and his sister."
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating police involvement with Graham Clarke before the death.
