Abellio Greater Anglia, which runs the Great East main line, has seen severe delays along the route recently.
Will Quince, Conservative MP for Colchester, said the House of Commons select committee for transport, would look at reliability and other issues.
The firm said it would work with any inquiry.
There have been delays across the region in recent weeks due to Abellio having to repair damage caused by leaves on the tracks damaging train wheels.
Statistics showed more than 36,000 journeys had been cancelled since the firm took over the regional network in 2012.
Mr Quince said: "The good news is we have got that inquiry and we will have that public airing of all these poor service issues that have been so prevalent over the past weeks, months and even years.
"I would say it's shambolic and the performance in the past few weeks has been verging on incompetent."
A select committee spokeswoman said it would hold a one-off session into the issues raised by Mr Quince, but the terms of reference or timetable for a full inquiry had yet to be agreed.
An Abellio Greater Anglia spokeswoman said: "We are working with Network Rail to do all we can to improve train service performance and reliability.
"We are continuing to work with politicians and stakeholders in making the case for the investment needed to deliver the significant improvements for the Norwich to London mainline that we all wish to see."
A Network Rail spokesman said: "We know how important this essential rail artery is to the region and are working closely with Abellio Greater Anglia to do all we can to improve performance."
