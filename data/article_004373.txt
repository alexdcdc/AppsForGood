The Environment Agency (EA) is proposing Â£10m in works to reduce the flood risk from the Calder and its tributaries.
About 370 properties were flooded on 26 December as heavy rain affected the Calder Valley.
Construction work on the scheme is expected to begin by the end of 2016.
Adrian Gill, area flood risk manager at the EA, said: "We are working closely with partners and the local community to reduce the risk of flooding in Mytholmroyd and we are keen to progress quickly.
"This action plan marks an important step in setting out our proposals to reduce flood risk and how we will involve the local community in these vital decisions."
The outline plan includes:
A series of consultation events are expected to take place to allow residents and businesses in the area to comment on the proposals.
Improved defences for the area were promised by the Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss when she visited the area in January.
