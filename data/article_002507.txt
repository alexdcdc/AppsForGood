Ahmed "Kathy" Kathrada  and Denis Goldberg were both jailed because of their activities during the Apartheid period.
Lord Mayor Jeffrey Mountevans said the honour was a "tribute to the noble and fearless fortitude" of the men.
They received the accolade with their defence team at the Guildhall.
The City of London said the men were awarded in recognition of their fight for freedom and racial equality.

Mr Goldberg, now 82, told a Q&A session that South Africa had "come a tremendously long way in undoing what the Apartheid government did" but "there is still a long way to go".
He told the audience he still did not know how he had been caught by police but at the time he was "certain we were going to be hanged".
Mr Kathrada, 86, organised protests for the ANC with Mr Goldberg even after the South African government had shut the group down.
He told the audience: "Even when we were banned we knew we had to carry on our work in some form or other."
Another political prisoner, Andrew Mlangeni, was also due to receive the Freedom of the City but was unable to attend the ceremony because of ill health.
His son attended in his absence along with Nelson Mandela's daughter and granddaughter.
