The facility at The Hive in Finnieston, opposite Lewbowskis, will also house a food market and cafe.
The proposal was given the go-ahead despite objections from neighbouring properties.
It will be built over two years.
The council has approved plans to form a new produce market and craft centre,  constructed using re-purposed ISO shipping containers, on a vacant industrial lot in Finnieston.
The application was submitted on behalf of Joe Mulholland, owner of The Hive and The Hidden Lane development - a community of over 100 studios in Finnieston where artists, designers, musicians and others work.
The approval comes despite objections from neighbours, who raised concerns about the aesthetics of using stacked shipping containers, as well as fears about noise levels and crowding.
Mr Mulholland said he believed those objecting to the new pedestrianised market would come round to the idea, because he was using quality materials and working with high-profile artists to "beautify" the containers - including Scots painter Alasdair Gray.
The developer told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: "Initially, people were against the idea of the Hidden Lane.
"But then when it happened, people were coming up to me in the street saying: 'thank you for what you have done for this area, you've really changed it.'"
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: "The council's Planning Applications Committee considered all aspects of this application, including representations from local residents."
It is anticipated that the development will be open daily between the hours of 08:00 and 22:00.
Finnieston, which has an industrial past, was named as the hippest place to buy a house in Britain in a top 20 list by The Times last year.
According to Right Move, the average price of a house in the up-and-coming area, often described as the "Shoreditch" of Glasgow, is Â£167,501
