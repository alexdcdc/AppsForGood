The council said 1,460 notices had been handed out since waste collection changes started on 27 July.
They included a roll-out of garden waste bins and smaller black refuse bins to boost recycling rates.
The warnings will lead to fines if residents continue to put out the wrong waste.
Most notices - 361 - were handed out in the Riverside area of the city, followed by Adamsdown and Grangetown.
No fines have yet been issued in Butetown, Cathays, Fairwater, Gabalfa, Whitchurch or Tongwynlais.
A Cardiff council spokesman said: "This isn't a heavy-handed approach as an education programme is running alongside the enforcement process and additional officers are actively working with crews advising and offering support to residents.
"But so far this week 593 section 46 notices have been issued to residents who haven't put their waste out in the correct manner.
"In order for us to reach our statutory recycling targets residents must adhere to the new waste collection methods. Those who do not will face a fine."
All councils in Wales must recycle 58% of their waste by March 2016 or face hefty fines.
