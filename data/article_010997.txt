The driver jumped the kerb and struck fellow cab drivers who were sitting awaiting their next fares, police said.
According to US media, the driver told police he mistakenly stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake.
The incident, on the eve of the Independence Day holiday in the US, was not believed to be terrorism-related.
Major Frank McGinn of Massachusetts State Police said one of the victims remains in serious condition, three had significant injuries and six others suffered less serious injuries.
All the victims appeared to be cab drivers, he added.
The driver, who is reported to be a 56-year-old man from Cambridge, Massachusetts, stayed at the scene to co-operate with police.
Maj McGinn told reporters the crash appeared to be "just a tragic accident".
He said the unidentified driver is known to be a "very nice gentlemen from his peers" and was thought to have been alone in the vehicle at the time.
Police have seized the cab and the cause of the crash remains under investigation, state police said in a statement.
"At this preliminary point in the investigation, there is no information that suggests the crash was intentional," the statement said.
