Andrew Gray, a former assistant Scout leader who taught disabled children swimming, was arrested after police raided the home he shared with his parents in Dundee.
Officers discovered hundreds of indecent images of children that he had downloaded from the internet.
The 37-year-old was placed on supervision for three years.
Gray, who won gold in the 25-metre butterfly at the 2007 games in Shanghai, was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and placed on the sex offenders register for five years.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told previously that police officers discovered the material after receiving confidential information.
A computer tower and external hard drive were recovered and contained indecent images of children and internet searches including "naked toddler".
A total of 893 images were recovered, with 87 at the most serious level.
Gray, of Dundee, admitted taking or making indecent images of children at his home between 18 March and 29 August last year.
Sheriff Alastair Brown ordered Gray to take part in a sex offenders group work programme and to abide by strict conditions on his access to the internet.
The sheriff told him: "Quite apart from anything else these images are of real children - these things have really happened to them.
"They have been abused and the only reason for that is to provide images for people who want to look at them.
"By viewing them you help to make the abuse happen.
"If you ever do this again, and in particular if you share images with anyone else, you can expect to go to prison for several years."
