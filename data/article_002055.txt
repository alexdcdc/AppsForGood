Robert Amoroso, 64, who now lives in Hampshire, lived on the Clifton estate between 1979 to 2013, when the offences were alleged to have taken place.
He faces 16 charges including seven indecent assaults, three sexual assaults and six of sexual activity with children aged between 11 and 15.
Mr Amoroso denies the charges. The trial is expected to last two weeks.
On Monday, the jury was shown two videos of interviews filmed by Nottinghamshire Police in 2013.
In the film, one victim, then aged 11, told officers how he visited Mr Amoroso's home with a friend.
He went on to give a graphic account of sexual activity he witnessed.
Two boys claim the abuse allegedly continued into adulthood.
The trial continues.
