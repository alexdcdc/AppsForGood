Germany international Hummels, 27, signed a five-year deal with the champions on Monday after the move was confirmed earlier this month.
The two clubs have agreed a "silence" over the fee, although it has been reported Bayern have paid about Â£30m.
Meanwhile, midfielder Mario Gotze says he will not leave Bayern this summer despite being linked with Liverpool.
The 23-year-old, who has been named in Germany's preliminary squad for Euro 2016, has only made 11 league starts this season, but says he wants to stay and impress new manager Carlo Ancelotti.
The former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss takes charge at the Allianz Arena this summer, replacing Manchester City-bound Pep Guardiola.
"I look forward to the new season in Munich and will do everything possible to be in top shape for my first training session under Carlo Ancelotti," said Gotze.
Bayern won the German title for a record fourth year in a row this season.
