The plans by property investor Formal Investments include a new-build on Bath Street with 130,000 sq ft of office space.
A building on Bath Street which was previously occupied by a BHS store will also be remodelled and refurbished.
A third building on Sauchiehall Street and Renfield Street will be improved to create retail space and offices.
The properties were acquired last year by Formal Investments.
Director Nicholas King said: "This proposal shows a really exciting vision for an important site in Glasgow city centre and will provide the highest quality environments for retailers and businesses large and small."
The architectural design work for the redevelopment has been carried out by Glasgow practice Stallan-Brand.
