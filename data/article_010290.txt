Defender Liam Cooper and winger Hadi Sacko may well feature, but full-back Charlie Taylor (Achilles) remains out.
Kyle Bartley, Liam Bridcutt and Chris Wood are among those who could be rested by Leeds boss Garry Monk.
Sutton welcome back captain Jamie Collins and winger Roarie Deacon, who has scored four goals in his side's run to the fourth round.
That includes a stunning equaliser in their 3-1 victory at AFC Wimbledon in round three.
Collins returns following a two-match ban for collecting 10 yellow cards, while Deacon was left out of the midweek FA Trophy win over Worthing as he would have missed the Leeds game had he been booked.
Deacon, 25, started his career in the same age group at Arsenal as England midfielder Jack Wilshere, and wants to use Sunday's game as a platform to move back up the leagues.
"I want to get back to the top and playing at big stadiums against big teams, so showing what I can do against Leeds is another step in that direction," said Deacon.
"You always think as you go through the age groups, signing scholarships, professional contracts, that your chance will come.
"But it didn't happen for me, which happens to a lot of players, so you just have to take it on the chin and move on, which I did."
Sutton manager Paul Doswell said he is hoping for another big performance from "talisman" Deacon.
He added: "We've dubbed him the magic man and it's fair to say without his magic we would not be sitting here now."
