Speaking to the States Assembly, Senator Andrew Green said there was enough space in the island to accommodate people fleeing the war.
He told the States they should be prepared to welcome some people who were in desperate need.
Chief Minister, Senator Ian Gorst had previously confirmed the island could take up to 30 refugees.
He said talks were being held with the UK.
He said: "I am convinced that we in Jersey need to play our part, even though it is only a small part.
"We are talking a small number of families, probably five or six families or between 20 and 30 refugees."
In Guernsey, the States have made no further progress in negotiations with the UK over taking refugees.
Former housing minister Terry Le Main said the island was heavily populated with a housing shortage.
Jersey has about 2,100 people per square mile, compared to 660 to each square mile in the United Kingdom.
"We have a social housing shortage, and there is also a severe shortage of affordable homes for first time buyers. It's a huge problem," Mr Le Main said.
Mr Green said there was spare capacity and a number of people had already offered to house them. He said: "These are genuine refugees, people fleeing for their lives. We will house them.
"I wouldn't want to frighten local people by telling them they will be disadvantaged by helping a few helpless, homeless people fleeing from war."
Mr Gorst said any refugees would come directly from the camps, in line with the plans of UK Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the last census in 2011 half of Jersey residents were born in Jersey with about a third being born elsewhere in the British Isles.
