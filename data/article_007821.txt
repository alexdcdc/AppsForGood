The Dorset Knob Throwing contest in Cattistock involves participants tossing a locally made, spherical biscuit as far as they can.
Organiser Nigel Collins said 5,000 people were expected to attend the event later.
The men's title was won last year by Dave Phillips with a record throw of 29.4m (96ft).
Mr Phillips broke the previous record of 26.1m (85.6ft) set by Philip German-Ribon which had stood for four years.
The savoury biscuits have to be thrown underarm and one of the competitor's feet must remain on the ground during the toss in order for it to count - the best of three is measured and recorded.
"They are a hard crusted projectile, about the size of a golf ball," Mr Collins said.
"We get some people who are very competitive, the best thing to do is relax, visualise where you think it's going to end up and pray."
The winner receives their winning biscuit, a plaque and their name is added to a board in the village hall.
Other events include a knob eating contest and knob darts.
