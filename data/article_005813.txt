Vincent Waddington, 18, was found fatally injured after a collision in Garston, Liverpool on 14 July 2015.
Luke Kendrick, 26, and Ryan Bate, 24, were both sentenced to life at Liverpool Crown Court and given six years each for wounding another man.
The judge ruled they must must serve at least 25 and 24 years respectively before becoming eligible for parole.
Det Insp Nick Price of Merseyside Police said he hoped the convictions would give Mr Waddington's family "some sense of justice and closure".
The teenager was a pillion passenger when he was fatally shot on Banks Road.
Det Ch Supt Paul Richardson, head of the Matrix Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said the case showed the "harrowing effects of gun crime".
"A young man who should have been looking forward to the experiences of the rest of his life, a family torn apart by grief and a community shocked and frightened."
Police are appealing for the public's help in finding David Ungi, 24.
They believe the 24-year-old has information about Mr Waddington's death.
