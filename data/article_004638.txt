Nicola Yates, who has been in charge of the city since 2009, will officially leave the post on 8 July.
No reason has been given for Ms Yates departure from the Â£160,000 a year post. The council has not confirmed who will replace her.
Ms Yates said in a short statement that running the authority had been both challenging and enjoyable.
Ms Yates, who was awarded the OBE for services to local government in 2010, joined Hull City Council in 2008 as deputy chief executive.
She had previously been chief executive of North Shropshire District Council.
Stephen Brady, leader of the Labour-controlled council, said: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank Nicola for her time, hard work and dedication to Hull and the Council.
"I wish her all the best in the future."
Ms Yates said: "My role as chief executive of Hull City Council has been enjoyable and challenging and I wish the council, its staff and the city the very best in the years ahead."
