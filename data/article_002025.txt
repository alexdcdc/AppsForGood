"I loved every second of playing with him and we just gel and get along so well," Watson told BBC Radio Guernsey.

Watson went out in the first round of the singles to Annika Beck after failing to convert three match points in a dramatic final set.
In the mixed doubles the pair received two walkovers before beating defending champions Martina Hingis and Leander Paes in round three.
"I had great partners in both doubles and mixed doubles to lift me up and I ended up playing really well in both, so I'm glad I stuck with it," she added.
"Henri said as soon as we won our first match he thought we'd win it and I thought, 'you know what, me too."
Next up for the Guernsey player is the Olympics in August with Watson one of four players confirmed to represent Great Britain in Brazil.
"It's been a big goal of mine and I've been talking about it a lot," she said.
"It was big for me to make the cut to get in and be able to play in Rio, so now that I'm going I can't wait."
