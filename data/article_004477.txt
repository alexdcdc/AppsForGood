The retailer, which owns Asda in the UK, said total revenues fell 1.3% in its third quarter to $117bn compared with $119bn a year earlier.
Asda reported a 4.5% fall in like-for-like sales for the three months to 30 September.
It said sales volumes remained under pressure from discount supermarkets.
Sales at Asda have now fallen for five quarters in a row, making it the worst performing of the Big Four supermarkets.
In the previous quarter, Asda reported sales slumped by 4.7%, marking its worst performance in its 50-year history.
Asda chief executive Andy Clarke said the UK grocery market continued to be "challenging".
But he added the supermarket chain had the "financial strength and clear plan to sustain us through this period, while we take appropriate and considered action to further strengthen our competitive position".
Once currency fluctuations were taken into account, Walmart reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter sales of $122bn, up 2.8% on a year earlier.
Revenues at Walmart's US stores were lifted by a 1.5% rise in sales at stores open more than a year.
However, international sales fell 11.4% in the period.
Doug McMillon, chief executive of Walmart, said: "We are pleased with the continued sales growth in Walmart US and in our international business. Although we still have work to do, we are positioning for sustainable growth through investments in people and technology to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale."
The results come a month after Wal-Mart warned profits would be lower than forecast, because it was investing in e-commerce as well as increasing employees' wages.
The retailer's spending efforts are in part a reaction to slowing sales, as well as competition from online retailers like Amazon.
