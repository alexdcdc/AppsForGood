Ifor ap Glyn, who writes in Welsh, takes over from Gillian Clarke, who has held the post since 2008.
While the job does not carry a salary, the national poet is expected to compose new works in response to significant national events.
The Caernarfon-based poet was unveiled as Wales' fourth national poet in March.
Mr ap Glyn's first engagement was a joint reading with Ms Clarke.
He sees the job as an "ambassadorial role" and has promised to bring his own distinctive style to it.
"Obviously I write in Welsh so there's a challenge to get people who read Welsh to engage with poetry," he said.
"Then there's a challenge of getting stuff over into other languages, because it's important that the national poet represents all languages of Wales."
Ms Clarke said she would continue to champion poetry for the young and for the masses.
