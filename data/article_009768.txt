Jordan Cunliffe was 16 when he was jailed in 2008 for the murder of Garry Newlove.
Mr Newlove, 47, suffered head injuries in the attack by three teenagers and died in hospital two days later.
Cunliffe had applied to have his 12-year minimum term cut but it was rejected at the High Court in London.
He was found guilty of murder by a jury at Chester Crown Court in January 2008.
Mr Justice Mitting told the High Court he did not recommend a reduction in the tariff, which is the minimum term to be served before Cunliffe is eligible to apply for parole.
Mr Newlove had left his Warrington house to confront youths that had vandalised his wife's car.
During the short confrontation he was kicked "like a football", the trial of his killers heard.
Cunliffe, Adam Swellings and Stephen Sorton were jointly convicted of his murder in 2008.
The three were found guilty under a legal doctrine known as joint enterprise, which allows members of a group to be prosecuted for murder when it cannot be proved which individual inflicted the fatal blow.
Janet Cunliffe said of her son's failed appeal: "Today was about a tariff reduction but, at the end of the day, we are not interested in a tariff reduction.
"I'm interested in having his conviction quashed and getting him home as an innocent man."
