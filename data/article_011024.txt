The Devon side got a bonus-point win at Welford Road on Friday, leaving Leicester fifth with five games to go.
Tigers have a record 10 league titles, but face missing out on the play-offs for the first time since 2004.
"Leicester are in an awkward situation and I do feel a little bit for their coaching staff," Baxter told BBC Devon.
"They're wanting to evolve and they're wanting to change a little bit, and that's actually pretty difficult to do when your base line is being in Premiership finals every year and finishing in the top four.
"They are going to have a few tough moments to weather, and they're just going to have to be strong and weather it."
Baxter's side were Premiership runners-up last season and have not lost in the league since October.
Aaron Mauger is interim head coach at Leicester following the sacking of Richard Cockerill in January.
"The foundations here are very strong and at the moment it's just for them to weather the storm, be tough and just keep working hard," added Baxter.
"Look at this place - it's a hell of a stadium, there's a hell of a crowd here and they will come through it."
