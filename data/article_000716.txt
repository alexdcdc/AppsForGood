The winner has until 13 March 2017 to claim the money before it goes towards lottery-funded projects.
A spokesman for organisers Camelot urged players to check "pockets, bags and down the back of the sofa".

Under Lotto rules, as soon as the jackpot reaches £22m, the prize must be won in the next draw.
Nobody matched all six numbers on 14 September and the £24.5m prize was shared between three winners who matched five numbers plus the bonus ball, two of whom have come forward.
Andy Carter from The National Lottery said: "We're eager to find the mystery ticket-holder and unite them with their winnings.
"We're urging everyone who bought a Lotto ticket in Colchester, whether they are from the town or were just in the area at the time, to check their old tickets again or look anywhere a missing ticket could be hiding."
It is not known if the winning ticket was bought by an individual or a syndicate.
