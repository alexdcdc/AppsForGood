Voges made 269 not out and Marsh 182 as they added 449 - the highest for the fourth wicket in Tests - in a total of 583-4 declared.
Nathan Lyon took three wickets to reduce West Indies to 116-6 in Hobart.
However, Darren Bravo's unbeaten 94 guided them to 207-6, trailing by 376.
Bradman and Ponsford's record, made against England at The Oval, as stood since 1934.
The day belonged to Voges and Marsh, who added 132 in an untroubled first session after Australia resumed on 438-3.
Voges, 36 and playing only his 11th Test, made his maiden Test double hundred from 285 balls, which included 33 fours.
Marsh also looked to be heading for a double century but an attempted slog sweep off left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican, who finished with figures of 3-158, saw him caught by Bravo.
Australia declared during lunch and reduced the visitors to 81-4 at tea.
Josh Hazlewood trapped Kraigg Braithwaite lbw for two before Lyon claimed the wickets of Rajindra Chandrika, Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood.
Captain Steve Smith took a juggling catch at slip to dismiss Chandrika for 29, before Lyon held a brilliant return catch high to his left to remove Samuels and then had Blackwood caught at short leg by Joe Burns for a duck.
Denesh Ramdin was bowled by a Hazlewood delivery that kept low and Jason Holder was lbw to Peter Siddle - a decision that would have been overturned on height if West Indies had chosen to review the umpire's call.
Persistent showers had the players on and off the pitch during the afternoon but Bravo maintained his focus to steady West Indies' reply, although they still require 177 to avoid the follow-on.
