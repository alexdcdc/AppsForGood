Dyfed-Powys Police called in the Brecon Mountain Rescue Team just before midnight on Friday, after the group of four bikers from Kent became lost.
The party was found at the Claerwen Reservoir, near Rhayader.
A helicopter evacuation had to be abandoned, with a boat needed to ferry the bikers across the reservoir.
The Brecon rescue team said their members had to struggle 4.5km (2.8 miles) over difficult moorland, before reaching the lost party at about 03:00 BST on Saturday morning.
Due to the remote nature of the location, their team was also joined by rescuers from the Longtown Mountain Rescue Team.
The motorcyclists were cold and exhausted when discovered, and one had a medical condition which meant they could not walk back to safety.
Poor weather saw a coastguard co-ordinated helicopter forced to return to Caernarfon in Gwynedd.
However, with the aid of a Mid and West Wales Fire Service boat from Aberystwyth, the party was finally taken across the reservoir to a 4x4 vehicle.
A Brecon rescue team spokesperson added that it was "another example of rescue services, mountain rescue, fires Service and police, working together to effect a rescue in difficult terrain".
