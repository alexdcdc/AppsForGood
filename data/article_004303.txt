The "low three-figure" sum of money was taken from three purses which had been left unattended at the Aberdeen Sea Cadets base at Pocra Quay.
Insp Carron McKellar said: "This is a disgraceful incident which has left the victims shocked and upset."
Anyone with information on the theft is urged to contact Police Scotland.
Insp McKellar added: "It is understood that the suspect entered the building while visitors were in another part of the building and took the money. Nothing else has been taken."
