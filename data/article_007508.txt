Former world player of the year Messi, 27, has inspired Argentina in Brazil.
The Barcelona forward has scored in all three games and is one goal shy of Maradona's 1986 five-goal haul, but Mehmedi says it is not all about Messi.
"With all due respect for his qualities and class, I think too much is talked about just Messi," said Mehmedi, 23.

"He is exceptional, no question, but that is not all, he has very good players around him. We will not neglect the preparation nor in the game itself," the Freiburg striker said ahead of their last-16 clash.
Argentina are unbeaten in their six previous games against Switzerland but Mehmedi says his side are not heading into the game at Corinthians Arena just to make up the numbers against one of the pre-tournament favourites.
"Swap jerseys with Messi? I'm not here as a tourist," he said. "Switzerland is in the second round of a World Cup."
Mehmedi knows if his side can defeat Argentina in Sao Paulo they will cause one of the biggest shocks of the 2014 tournament in Brazil.
"I know the quality and potential of this team," he continued.
"If we defeat Argentina, we write a piece of World Cup history and many people in Switzerland will be proud of the team.
"I even think such success would see the world take notice, but we are not naive.
"It will take an absolutely top performance of each one of us. And I assure you, everyone will do everything we can to provide these and tearing for Switzerland."
