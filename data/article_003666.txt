The Seasiders have drawn 13 games this season, the joint-most of any side in the division, and are 15th in the table, seven points off the play-offs.
Bowyer's side conceded in injury time to surrender a two-goal lead in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Exeter, their seventh draw in 10 games.
"We need some leaders to make some demands on players," Bowyer said.
Despite their run of stalemates, Blackpool, who have a game in hand on many of their rivals, are still in touch of the play-offs heading into Tuesday's fixture against Barnet.
Bowyer took charge of Blackpool in June after the club suffered successive relegations from the Championship and League One.
Having "steadied the ship" the former Blackburn boss believes that, with 14 league games remaining, now is the time for his players to go out of their comfort zone and kick on.
The 45-year-old told BBC Radio Lancashire: "Everyone in our dressing room wants the same thing and that's success.
"To do that you've got to go out of your comfort zone a bit and put some demands on each other.
"It might mean you have to upset your team-mate on the pitch, but if it's for the good of the team then that needs to be said."
