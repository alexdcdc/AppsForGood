Almost 700 people with torches climbed Barrow, Stile End and Outerside, above Braithwaite on Saturday as part of the Lakeland Festival of Light.
At dusk, pictures were taken of the torches which were used to represent the colours of Nepalese prayer flags.
The event, the third of its kind, is expected to raise Â£10,000.
Mountain guide Matt Le Voi, who organised the event, said the results had been "immensely satisfying."
He added: "I think we have absolutely nailed it. To see the mountains lit up in the various colours to make them look like Nepalese prayer flags is brilliant.
"I can already feel the pressure around what we can do next year. But with this much support for an amazing cause I think it's only right that we continue doing this until people don't want to bother any more.
"We've had about 700 people taking part, which is the largest number since we started.
"All the money is going to the charity PHASE Worldwide, which we support and do fantastic work in Nepal."
