The culprits made off with cash and drinks including champagne and spirits in the break-in at Vecchia Bologna overnight on Friday, 5 December.
It is thought more than one person was involved in the raid given the quantity of alcohol taken.
Officers have warned the alcohol may be offered for sale in the Stirling area.
They appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
