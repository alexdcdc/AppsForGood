Coleman, 46, led Wales to their first major tournament in 58 years when they reached Euro 2016 in France.
During the competition, they made it to their first semi-final before losing to eventual winners Portugal.
Coleman played for Swansea City, Crystal Palace, Blackburn and Fulham but his career was cut short following a car accident.
He later had spells as manager of Fulham, Coventry and Spanish side Real Sociedad.
He was appointed Wales manager following the death of his good friend Gary Speed in 2012 and after a difficult start, turned things around on the pitch to reach Euro 2016.
Swansea lord mayor, councillor David Hopkins, said: "Freedom of the city is the highest honour the people of Swansea can confer on one of its own.
"And after the amazing, incredible exploits of the last month in France, I think I can safely say everyone in Swansea believes it's richly-deserved."
