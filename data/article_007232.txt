Leading Premier League clubs reportedly met this week to discuss the idea of a breakaway competition featuring the continent's top teams.
But Glenn said closing off the league to certain teams would put fans off.
"Football has to keep evolving [but] we can't lose the principles of promotion and relegation," he told the BBC.
Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal and Arsenal have already declared they are against a European super league.
Glenn, who was appointed a year ago, drew on the example of Premier League leaders Leicester, who would not be able to join the mooted elite should they go on to win the title.
He also said the way the Premier League distributed equal TV money to its clubs allowed teams such as the Foxes to attain their current status.
Last season, Premier League teams earned £50m each, but in Spain, for example, Barcelona and Real Madrid earn a larger proportion of TV money than other clubs - although that is set to change this year.
From next season, when a new TV deal kicks in, the Premier League's bottom club will earn £99m, with the champions taking in excess of £150m in TV money.
Glenn added: "Isn't it brilliant to see a team like Leicester upsetting the applecart?
"And that's only possible because the Premier League shares the riches quite evenly, in contrast to most other European countries where a few teams get the lion's share.
"It would be a real shame to miss that, a real shame to not have a Leicester phenomenon every year to bring in some variety and challenge."
