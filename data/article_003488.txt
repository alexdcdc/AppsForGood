In the final Old Firm match of the season Caixinha's men were dismantled by the champions, who sealed their biggest ever win at Ibrox.
"We played well but I am to blame, it is my total responsibility," Caixinha said.
"Things didn't go in the direction we were supposed to have planned so I am the man responsible."
Celtic, who have won five of the six Old Firm matches this season, with the other a 1-1 draw, took an early lead through Scott Sinclair's penalty.
Brendan Rodgers' champions were in confident mood and Leigh Griffiths doubled their lead before half time.
Callum McGregor and Dedryck Boyata extended the lead before Kenny Miller replied for Rangers, but Mikael Lustig curled in a late goal to restore the four-goal cushion.
Despite the manner of the defeat and the scoreline, Caixinha felt his side performed better than in last week's 2-0 Scottish Cup semi-final defeat at the hands of the same opponents.
"The players tried to do their very best, they had a fantastic attitude and they raised their level," the Portuguese added.
"I saw more from my players this week than in last weekend's Scottish Cup semi-final defeat, the way we started the game was in that direction.
"You need to judge me all the time. From day one since I came here. I not a guy who puts the responsibility on others, I take it all the time.
"So judge me all the time. For things that are not going in the right direction I am responsible and I always will be."
The gulf between the sides was brutally evident for Rangers' fans and while Caixinha is confident of cutting the gap to their rivals, he admits major surgery is required in the summer.
"We need to make a lot of changes, we are very keen to reduce the difference," he said.
"It is possible to bridge the gap and we need to do it. That's what everyone is working hard towards."
