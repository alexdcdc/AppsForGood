Storey, on loan from Swindon Town, put the hosts ahead inside the opening 15 minutes, drilling a low shot into the bottom corner.
Kgosi Ntlhe's chipped finish was ruled out for offside after the break as Peterborough pushed for an equaliser.
Striker Craig Westcarr also had a goal disallowed, but Pompey held on to beat their third-tier opponents.
The result means Portsmouth progress to the second round of the competition for the first time since 2010.
