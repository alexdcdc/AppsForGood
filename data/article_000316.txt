The 30-year-old signed for the Giants in 2016 and joins Mark Garside in committing his future to the franchise.
Garside, 28, will stay at the club for an eighth year in a row after spending four years with the Edinburgh Capitals.
"I am really happy to be back and excited to spend another season in Belfast chasing trophies," said Martinelli.
Head Coach Adam Keefe said Martinelli was "a great guy to have around the locker room" and is "excited" about Garside's extending his stay also.
"Mark has won two league titles in Belfast, as well as the recent World Championship gold and he will play a key part in our chase for silverware."
Garside was a member of the Giants squad who helped the club win league championships in 2011-12 and 2013-14, while he was part of the GB national side which clinched gold in the recent World Championship hosted in Belfast.
