Angus Cameron targeted three separate girls over the course of almost two months in St Andrews.
Cameron, 66, was  sentenced to three years supervision and placed on the sex offenders register for three years.
A court was told that he was caught after his victims, aged 15 and 16, went to guidance teachers, who contacted police.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Roberton told Dundee Sheriff Court that all three girls were in uniform at the time of the attacks.
She said the first assault took place on a 15-year-old girl on a date in December last year.
Miss Robertson added: "The first girl felt him grabbing her inner thigh and squeezing as he went by.
"She shouted out 'oh my god - he just touched me'."
The assaults were repeated on two more occasions, in January and February this year.
In the second incident he touched a 16-year-old girl's inner thigh and groin, before touching a 15-year-old girl on her inner thigh.
Miss Robertson said: "At the third attack the girl said 'that man just grabbed my leg'.
"The girls were able to give an accurate description of the accused and he was traced by police.
"During police interview he was asked why he had done it and he replied, 'for a wee bit of a thrill.'"
Cameron, of Culzean Crescent, Kirkcaldy, admitted three charges of sexual assault under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act.
Sheriff George Way imposed a community payback order with three years supervision and a requirement to take part in a sex offender groupwork programme.
He was also banned from entering St Andrews for a year and placed on the sex offenders register for three years.
