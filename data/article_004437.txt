Gibbs was serving at 2-1 up in the third set when the players were called off on Sunday because of rain.
Following a further delay on Monday, Watson twice broke the American's serve as she won five games in a row to seal victory and her place at the Olympics.
Kyle Edmund also won but fellow Briton Naomi Broady was beaten.
British number three Edmund overcame Georgian qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili 7-6 6-7 7-5 6-1, winning nine of the last 10 games.
The Davis Cup winner will now face 15th seed John Isner or Australia's John Millman.
"It was a real battle out there," said Edmund. "My opponent was playing some high-level tennis."
On her French Open debut, Broady took Coco Vandeweghe to a deciding set but was beaten 6-4 3-6 6-3 by the American.
Fellow Britons Johanna Konta and Laura Robsn are both scheduled to start on Tuesday.
Watson arrived at Roland Garros with points to defend having reached the second round last year.
A first-round loss would have left the world number 54 in danger of missing the Olympics, which start in Rio on 5 August.
The cut-off comes immediately after the French Open, with the 56 top-ranked eligible players qualifying.
Given only four players from any one country can compete, a ranking in the low 60s will be good enough.
"I just wanted to win this match, just because I felt I'm hitting the ball really well at the moment," said Watson.
"I would have been really disappointed if I would have lost playing the way I am.
"I slept awfully last night. I couldn't get to sleep. My mind was going over everything in my whole life, not just the tennis match."
