The company said a "processing error" led to a number of its customers at "some" stores in the Midlands being charged a second time on Thursday for purchases made on 4 and 7 August.
Some 4% of all transactions made in the UK on those dates were affected by the technical fault, Aldi said.
All affected customers were reimbursed within 24 hours, the supermarket added.
When asked if customers would be refunded for any overdraft fees they might have incurred, a spokesman for the company said it was advising customers to contact their bank.
Shoppers took to Twitter to complain about money being taken from their bank accounts.
