Wycombe offered the 23-year-old a new deal in the summer and turned down a bid for him on deadline day in August.
"I've been in exactly the same place (as Aaron)," said Ainsworth.
"You feel loyal because this is the club that gave you the chance but you're also ambitious and have agents in your ears saying 'you can't sign a new contract as it's career suicide'."
He continued: "All I know is that when Aaron puts a shirt on he gives his absolute best for Wycombe. If he goes on to have a fantastic career in League One, the Championship or the Premier League, we have to be proud of him."
Since moving to Adams Park from Brentford in 2014, Pierre has made 127 appearances and Ainsworth has said he is "probably the best centre-half in League Two".
He told BBC Three Counties Radio: "I'm hoping he's here in May and June and still playing because that means nobody came in.
"But I always live in fear because he's a fantastic player and I think he can play higher. I dread saying that because I know he might go one day."
