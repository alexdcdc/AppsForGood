The ringed bird, known as KL, produced three chicks in the nest at Bassenthwaite near Keswick last year. Two were killed by magpies.
She has been joined this year by an unringed male.
The Lake District Osprey Project team said they were "delighted", as the birds do not always return to the same nest sites.
Project manager Nathan Fox said they were "hopeful for another successful nesting season".
The birds have been seen mating since they arrived, having spent the winter in west Africa.
Ospreys returned to the Lake District in 2001, after an absence of more than 150 years.
They have nested successfully every year, raising nearly 30 chicks.
The birds can been seen from specially-created viewpoints and visitors can watch live nest-cam images on screens at Whinlatter visitor centre.
