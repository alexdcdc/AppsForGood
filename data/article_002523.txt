The annual sporting rich-list showed Mayweather, who also topped last year's list, earned US$300m (£194m).
Most of that came from his 'super-fight' with Manny Pacquiao, whose $160m (£103.4m) takings made him the second-highest earner.
Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo was third with $79.6m (£51.4m).
The figures include salaries, bonuses, prize money and appearance fees, plus estimates of endorsement income for the past 12 months.
Golfer Tiger Woods remains in the top 10 thanks to his $50.6m (£32.7m) worth of endorsements. The American earned just $600,000 (£387,000) in winnings because of injury and poor form.
