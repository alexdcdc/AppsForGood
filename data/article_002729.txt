"Yes it was obviously frustrating.
"Before the game you're hopeful it's going to be an opportunity to get three points at home. It doesn't matter who we play, we always think that.
"Credit to them - I thought they came and worked extremely hard. Conditions were very difficult, I think most people could see that.
"It looked hard work for the lads out there but the important thing from my point of view is we didn't lose the game. We would have liked to have won it but I saw effort out there."
