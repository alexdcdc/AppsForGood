The festival of music, theatre, comedy and arts returns to Suffolk on 17 July.
Melvin Benn said yoga was a natural addition to the line-up.
"I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to say working class people don't do yoga, but yoga absolutely reinforces our middle class credentials and I've no qualms about that at all," he said.
Mr Benn, who created the festival nine years ago, said he had wanted to offer yoga sessions in the campsites at Henham Park "for a while".
"I think a lot of people will be pleased," he said.
The Black Keys, Two Door Cinema Club and Damon Albarn are the musical headliners for this year's festival, with Jack Dee, Alison Moyet and the Royal Shakespeare Company also on the bill.
The festival will have the theme of "secrets and lies", inspired by CIA whistle-blower Edward Snowden.
This will involve a series of political debates held across the weekend along with artistic interpretations of the theme, including a ballet performance highlighting how dance would be used to express the secrets of the royal household in mediaeval times.
