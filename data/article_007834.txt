The 29-year-old joined the English Championship club in 2013 after leaving Motherwell.
But he made the last of 14 appearances this season in October.
Humphrey told Hibs' website: "They're a big club and it will be great to play at Easter Road again. They are pushing hard for promotion and I'll hopefully be able to help us achieve that."
The winger, who has 12 caps for Jamaica, spent four years at Fir Park after joining Motherwell from Shrewsbury Town.
Humphrey helped Preston win promotion from League One via the play-offs in 2015 but has struggled for game time this season, making only seven starts.
He made 134 appearances for Preston, but the English club announced on their website that: "Chris Humphrey has agreed a mutual cancellation of his contract with immediate effect."
Following Saturday's 2-1 win that took Hibs back to the top of the Scottish Championship, manager Neil Lennon said: "Hopefully he'll be in on Monday."
Lennon did not expect to make many more changes to his squad during January.
"Not many unless there's a bit of to and fro-ing out of the squad to bring players in" he said.
Lennon pointed out that midfielders John McGinn and Fraser Fyvie, plus goalkeeper Ofir Marciano, were close to returning from injury to bring his squad back to full strength.
