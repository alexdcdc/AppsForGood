The note will be a limited edition that will be auctioned to raise money for BBC Children in Need this autumn.
Kayla Robson, at Morgan Academy, won the competition which challenged children to design part of the £5 Bank of Scotland banknote.
The theme was What does BBC Children in Need mean to you? The note will be Bank of Scotland's first polymer note.
The circulation will be limited to just 50 notes, which officials believe will make it popular among collectors.
The charity's iconic mascot, Pudsey Bear will be on the note with Kayla's design depicting him wearing a kilt and raising a Saltire on the back.
Graeme Donald, Bank of Scotland competition judge said: "The bank received over 4,000 entries to this competition, a fantastic response, and all the judges were blown away with the quality of the entries and the imagination and creativity shown by the children.
"Choosing a winner was not an easy process but when we looked at Kayla's design, which combines brilliantly the use of colour and shading, we felt it brought home what BBC Children in Need means to so many people as well as having all the right attributes to make a great £5 note.
"This will be the first time the designs of children have been incorporated on a Scottish banknote and we hope to raise lots of money for BBC Children in Need."
The winner Kayla Robson said: "I love drawing and have always enjoyed raising money for BBC Children in Need in school.
"I am very excited at winning and can't wait to see my design on the £5 note."
Last month the bank announced that its next £5 and £10 banknotes will be printed on polymer.
The design of the main replacement polymer £5 note will be unveiled before the end of this year with the note itself issuing in the second half of 2016. It will be followed a year later by the polymer £10 note.
