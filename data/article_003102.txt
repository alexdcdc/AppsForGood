The 26-year-old spent the majority of the 2015-16 campaign on loan at Ashton Gate, making 38 appearances.
Baker played 34 times for Villa last season, but boss Steve Bruce has since signed John Terry and Chris Samba.
"I loved the loan spell here; I got to play games regularly and that's what I want to do again," Baker told the club website.
"It helps that I know the club already, but the main thing for me is the potential of the club - it was an easy decision for me."
Baker's arrival at Bristol City adds doubt over the future of Aden Flint, the former Swindon Town defender heavily linked with a summer transfer.
Speaking on Wednesday, Robins head coach Lee Johnson said "categorically we have had no bids" for any players.
City already have plenty of central defensive options, with Flint, Bailey Wright, Hordur Magnusson and Taylor Moore, plus youngsters Zak Vyner and Lloyd Kelly.
