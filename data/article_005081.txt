The child will be starting a new school in September wearing a boy's uniform.
Speaking to Radio Ulster's Nolan show, he said it was "difficult growing up being trapped in the wrong body".
His mother said she "wasn't shocked" by the revelation and has supported his decision.
The child told Stephen Nolan that he has "always known he was a boy", found wearing dresses "horrible" and feels much happier now that he has opened up about it.
"I couldn't take it any longer so I had to come out," he said.
"I was crying at night, crying myself to sleep - it was just horrible.
"I told my mum, 'I'm transgender. I want to be a boy. I'm not a girl. Please accept me'."
The 11-year-old's mother said the decision did not come as too much of a surprise as her son had been "having a bit of trouble with identity and sexuality".
"I just reassured him that everything would be ok and I would always be there for him," she said.
"It doesn't make him any less my child."
She said, however, that she is "constantly worried" at how other children will react and has also experienced comments from adults that he is "too young for this".
"I have come up against it but in this day and age, children are becoming more aware of their feelings at a younger age. Who am I to argue at what's going on in his head?" she asked.
The child's mother said she did find the recent change of name and pronouns difficult.
"I've had a daughter for 12 years and now I've got to think on him as a son. So it's a wee bit like a grieving process if you like."
Her son will be beginning his new school in a few weeks and he said he is starting off with a positive attitude.
"Even though there are going to be those people who can't accept it, I'm still excited to make new friends".
