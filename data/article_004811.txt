Adam Jones, from Wednesbury, was struck by a Volkswagen Bora which was travelling from Stone Cross towards Walsall on Wednesday evening.
He was flung through the car windscreen and was pronounced dead a short time later, West Midlands Police said.
A man arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving has been released without charge.
The collision happened on Walsall Road, Friars Park, Wednesbury, just after 19:30 GMT on Wednesday as Adam was crossing the road with his bicycle.
Insp Paul Bennett said: "This was a shocking collision which has cost a young man his life and we are determined to find the person responsible for his death.
"The driver of the vehicle would have known that Adam had suffered catastrophic injuries, yet he still ran away without seeking medical assistance for him.
"I am appealing to him directly to do the right thing and come forward."
Insp Bennett also asked for anyone with information about the car to contact the police.
The car, a Volkswagen Bora, is bright blue and has stickers on the rear windscreen. The vehicle registration number is WA52 XVV.
