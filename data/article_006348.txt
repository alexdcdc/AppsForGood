It is the 37-year-old's first managerial role since retiring from playing four years ago.
Leatherhead are currently 23rd in the Isthmian League Premier Division, having lost four of their seven league games this season.
Tanners chairman Richard Brady said Bullard had "a very clear philosophy" of how he wants the side to play.
"Jimmy has gained a wealth of experience into a variety of management and coaching techniques as a player and is looking to bring the best of these experiences to Leatherhead," Brady added in a statement on the club website.
Bullard, who also had spells with Peterborough, Wigan, Ipswich and MK Dons during his playing career, has worked regularly in the media since his retirement.
