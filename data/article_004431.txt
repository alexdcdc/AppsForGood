The 53-year-old was held on suspicion of assault and blackmail and has been bailed, Greater Manchester Police said.
The arrest follows two alleged attacks on men accused of grooming offences in Wigan.
The men, aged 25 and 19, had allegedly arranged to meet who they believed were 14-year-old girls on the internet.
But when they arrived for the pre-planned rendezvous, they were beaten and filmed by a group of men.
One of the videos was later posted on Facebook, before money was allegedly demanded from the attackers.
Andrew O'Neill, 25, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, has since admitted a charge of grooming at Wigan Magistrates' Court.
Shoppers at Market Place in Wigan had witnessed O'Neill being assaulted at about 14:40 BST on Saturday, the court heard.
Police said the 19-year-old victim was attacked and filmed after believing he had arranged to meet a 14-year-old girl in a church car park, in Atherton, near Wigan, at about 21:00 BST on Friday.
He is also accused of arranging to meet an under-age girl and was arrested and later released on bail.
A 25-year-old man also arrested on suspicion of assault and blackmail has been bailed.
