The Springbok, 27, who arrived at the Premiership side on a short-term deal in February, has helped the club win three of their past four games.
The length of the player's fresh contract has not been disclosed.
"Francois has had a huge influence on the side in a short space of time. We hope he can be a catalyst for us moving forward," Warriors boss Dean Ryan said.
Hougaard scored a try on his Worcester debut in their win over Sale and produced a man-of-the-match performance in the 15-14 victory at Newcastle on 4 March - the club's first away success in the Premiership for two years.
"I haven't been here long but I've become really fond of Worcester," Hougaard told the Sixways club's website.
"The club have great ambitions, which is something I'm really excited about being a part of.
"Now my aim is to help drive Warriors up the Aviva Premiership table and to achieve our long-term goal of becoming a top European side."
After going 13 games without a win in all competitions, Warriors' recent revival in the Premiership has eased their relegation fears and taken them 13 points clear of bottom club London Irish.
