Dan Fitchett netted the opener on 17 minutes, meeting Craig Eastmond's cross with a bullet header following a smart one-two out wide with Ross Stearn.
Stearn was involved again as Sutton made it two only six minutes later when his corner was met by Nicky Bailey, who headed low into the net.
But a Bobby-Joe Taylor penalty on 25 minutes halved the deficit almost immediately, before Jamar Loza levelled on the stroke of half-time with his first goal for Maidstone.
