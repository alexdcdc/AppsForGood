 Our pools are full of disinfectant chemicals that keep then free of microorganisms, but what you might not realize is that those same chemicals are interacting with, well, you. Today we're talking poolchem, and we're going to answer that age old question that's been pondered in the back of every deep end swimmer's mind - is it really okay to pee in the pool?

 Ever wonder why dogs sniff each others' butts? Or how Adderall works? Or whether it's OK to pee in the pool? We've got you covered: Reactions a web series about the chemistry that surrounds you every day. 
  
  
  
 Reactions is produced by the American Chemical Society. ||||| Peeing in the public pool is gross, immature, but basically harmless, right? A quick fix when you’ve really gotta go? Not exactly. In advance of the its annual summer meeting, the American Chemical Society has just released a video explaining, in gory scientific detail, why peeing in the pool makes it a more unhealthy environment for everybody, you disgusting hairless flesh monster. 
  
  
  
 It all comes down to chemistry, and some nasty little compounds known as disinfection byproducts, or DBPs. Associated with health problems ranging from eye irritation to asthma, DBPs are created when sweat, urine, and dirt from your body interact with cleaning chemicals like chlorine. They’re also responsible for that familiar summertime “pool smell,” which probably evokes happy childhood memories. Sorry to burst the bubble, but that soothing scent is actually the result of the neighborhood kids’ bodily excretions.

 So, unless you want to be swimming in a toxic stew, do us all a favor and use the toilet and shower like a goddamn adult—and make sure your kids do, too.
