GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – Goodlettsville police say a woman shot her ex-boyfriend after he was allegedly found hiding under a bed at her home Tuesday afternoon. 
  
 It happened just before 3 p.m. in the 200 block of Shevel Drive. 
  
 According to police, the man entered the home, which was having an alarm system installed, while she went to a neighbor’s home for a few minutes. 
  
 “She was warning me about her ex-boyfriend and not to let him around me or my home,” a neighbor told News 2. 
  
 Police told News 2 the homeowner shot the man in self-defense and will likely not face charges. 
  
 Police said the woman had a restraining order against him and that he had three outstanding violations against that order. He will be charged on those outstanding warrants and more charges are pending. 
  
 “Good for her!” neighbor Mary Alice Lovell said. She told News 2 she has seen police cars over the victim’s residence before. 
  
 “In this case, if he was trying to abuse her and she had a gun and she had a restraining order against him, then she has to protect herself,” Lovell said. 
  
 The man, whose identity has not been released, suffered non-life threatening injuries. 
  
 News 2 spoke with the victim briefly over the phone.

 GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--A woman having a security system installed to protect against a man who threatened her life and was stalking her actually found the man hiding under her bed as the security system was being installed. 
  
 First reported on FOX 17 Tuesday, Metro Police affidavits now paint a clearer picture of the events leading up to the self-defense shooting. According to the report, 52-year-old Tony Joe Gunter and the woman had dated for two years when earlier this month she found out about his "extensive criminal history." The woman broke up with Gunter and instructed him not to return when he allegedly stated "I will kill you, you stupid c***." 
  
 Since that day, the woman says she has changed her locks twice and had three different occasions where she came home and found signs Gunter had broken in and was there. She also filed an order of protection against Gunter.

 The woman called ADT security to have a system installed on Tuesday and says she was on her cell phone and computer as the ADT rep was installing the system. She says after the installer completed the job, she went to her room to check the connection to her cell phone but her phone was missing. That is when she noticed Gunter's feet under her bed. 
  
 The woman told the ADT installer to call 911 and pulled a gun, shooting Gunter in the left foot as he was under her bed. She says she instructed Gunter to give back the phone and he threw it out from under the bed. She held Gunter at gunpoint until police arrived. 
  
 Gunter admitted to police he entered the home and hid under the bed, taking the phone to keep the woman from calling police. 
  
 The 52-year-old is facing charges of Aggravated Burglary, Stalking, Violating and Order of Protection and Theft. ||||| A Tennessee woman who found her stalker ex-boyfriend hiding under her bed shot him in the foot and held him until his arrest Tuesday, police said.
