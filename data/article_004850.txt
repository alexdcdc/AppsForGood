The first payments have been made to over 10,000 farmers across the UK - three-quarters of all eligible farmers
Northern Ireland farmers will receive  0.226p per litre of milk produced, compared to  0.176p per litre for farmers in England, Scotland and Wales.
This is because Northern Irish farmers have been suffering from some of the lowest prices across Europe.
Payments will continue through November and December.
When the package was announced in September it was reported that Northern Ireland dairy farmers would get £2,000 each from it.
The Ulster Farmers' Union said it was disappointed at the package, describing it as too little spread too thinly.
The unions says some farmers in Northern Ireland have been losing up to £2,000 a week due to the depressed milk price.
