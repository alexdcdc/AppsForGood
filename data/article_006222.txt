The proposals for the homes at Mill Lane, Greens Norton, are going before South Northamptonshire Council's development control committee.
The parish council has warned Mill Lane already has traffic problems as it is used by drivers to avoid queuing between the A43/A5 roundabouts.
But council officers say the scheme would not compromise safety.
The plan for the homes, in vacant field to the rear of Calvert Close with access via a track off Mill Lane, has been put forward by a Mr and Mrs R Hunt.
Isabel Lefever, the chairman of Greens Norton Parish Council, said in a submission to the committee that Mill Lane "has always been for villagers the most dangerous part of the entrance/exit to the village".
She said she was concerned that the development was also near a children's nursery.
But a report to the committee, meeting in the afternoon, says the local highways agency raises no objection to the scheme.
Council officers recommend the scheme is approved by councillors.
