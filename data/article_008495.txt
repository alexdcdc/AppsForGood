BATH, Ohio (AP) â€” Visitors heading to Ohio for the Republican National Convention have the rare opportunity to rent the childhood home of one of the country's most notorious killers. 
  
 The former Bath Township home of Jeffrey Dahmer is one of several private properties that real estate company Howard Hanna has made available for rent while the convention is underway in Cleveland in July. 
  
 The three-bedroom home about 25 miles south of Cleveland costs $8,000 to rent for the week. The listing describes the 1952 home as having a mid-century modern style with "a true park-like setting" and easy access to Interstate 77. 
  
 It's also the site of Dahmer's first murder in 1978. Then just 18, Dahmer killed hitchhiker Steven Hicks and disposed of his remains in the woods behind the property. He murdered 16 more victims and was killed in prison in 1994. 
  
 "If you get past that little problem, you'll have a wonderful place to live," said homeowner Chris Butler, a founding member of the 1980s new wave band The Waitresses. 
  
 Butler told the Akron Beacon Journal he put up the listing on a whim to "suck some Republican gelt from those people," using the Yiddish word for money. 
  
 He said he's been working to restore the home to a more authentic representation of its modern style in an attempt to improve its public image and move past the fact that Dahmer once lived there. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.
