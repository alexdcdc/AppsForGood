Weston-super-Mare's RNLI crew said they had already been called out more times this year than in the whole of 2014.
About 6.5m visitors head to the seaside resort each year.
Volunteer Glyn Hayes said: "They don't realise about our strong tides and leap into their little dinghies and drift out to sea and we go and get them."
The volunteer crew, temporarily stationed at Knightstone Causeway, aim to launch their lifeboat within eight minutes of their pagers going off.
"In terms of shouts this year, it's gone off 35 times," said Mr Hayes.
"Even on Sunday, when we had our open day, we had four shouts, all of which involved jet skis."
Their recent rescues include helping a couple found clinging to a derelict pier, retrieving two men from a sinking dinghy and aiding a water scooter rider who had run out of fuel.
"There is a degree of stupidity, but it's very difficult because in Weston even though it's a beautiful day, no wind, we've still got very strong currents," said Mr Hayes.
"I also think it's because we've had such indifferent weather.  People aren't getting their boats ready for the start of the season and then all of a sudden the weather turns nice and they rush out and do things they shouldn't be doing."
