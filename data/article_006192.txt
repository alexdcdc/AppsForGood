It followed the inadvertent release of personal information which was later posted on the internet.
It is understood that the data included redundancy payments to named local authority staff.
The ICO said that in light of remedial measures taken by the council, no further action was necessary.
The details were released in November last year in response to a Freedom of Information request from the  WhatDoTheyKnow website.
The council was eventually alerted to the blunder in February and immediately took steps to have the material removed from the web.
The authority said it was a genuine case of human error and offered a public apology to those affected.
A three-point action plan was subsequently undertaken to enhance data handling and protection procedures and prevent a repeat of the incident.
The ICO has now reviewed the case and issued its determination - a summary of which is included in a report to the authority's audit and risk management committee.
It concluded that the lack of "substantial damage and distress" to those affected, along with the steps taken after the incident, meant no further action was required.
