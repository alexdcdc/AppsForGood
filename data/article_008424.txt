The man was thought to have been struck by the van as he crossed Main Street in Bellshill at about 16:30 on Thursday.
He was taken to Monklands Hospital where staff described his condition as critical.
The driver of the van, a 31-year-old man, was left in shock following the incident. Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.
Sgt John Tait, of Police Scotland, said: "I would appeal to anyone who was on Main Street, close to Cross Orchard Way, on Thursday afternoon, to please get in contact if they witnessed this incident.
"We are yet to establish whether contact was made with the van and the pedestrian, or if the man had fallen within the proximity of the vehicle.
"We are still assessing opportunities to capture CCTV and information from the public could really help us in determining the circumstances surrounding the incident."
