The 18-year-old is scheduled to stay with the League One play-off hopefuls until Sunday 3 April, the day of their Johnstone's Paint Trophy final meeting with Oxford United at Wembley.
"Callum is exactly the type of player we were looking for," said caretaker head coach Paul Heckingbottom.
"We're excited to have him here. I'm sure he will help our cause."
Connolly, who can play in either full-back position or in midfield, is currently tied to Everton until the summer of 2017.
"We have a good relationship with Everton," added Heckingbottom.
"They have entrusted us with one of their highly-rated youngsters. We're both confident that this is the perfect environment for him to begin his professional career.
Barnsley, who will have Connolly's services for the next five League One games, are currently seventh in the table, with 12 games of the season left.
Despite the distraction of losing manager Lee Johnson to Bristol City, they have lost just once in 14 games since Christmas and have risen from the relegation zone to a position where only goal difference is keeping them out of the play-off zone, ahead of Saturday's trip to third-placed Walsall.
