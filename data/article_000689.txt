Luis Suarez was also on target to take the combined tally for him, Messi and Neymar to 100 goals this season in all competitions.
Messi scored his 20th and 21st league goals of the season as Barcelona took their unbeaten run to 36 games.
Munir El Haddadi had opened the scoring early and Suarez got on the scoresheet in the closing stages.
Barcelona took just eight minutes to take the lead as Messi's fine, aerial pass freed Suarez and his cross was tapped home by El Haddadi, who was deputising for the suspended Neymar.
Eibar missed the chance to equalise when an unmarked Gonzalo Escalante volleyed wide from six yards out.
The hosts were punished three minutes before half-time when Messi produced an excellent, low finish to double Barcelona's lead.
They were awarded a penalty 15 minutes from full-time when Ivan Ramis was penalised for handling a Messi cross, and the Argentine sent the spot kick down the middle to make it 3-0.
Suarez added the fourth when he beat defender Ander Capa and scored with a low shot with six minutes to play.
Barcelona also managed their first clean sheet since early February as they closed out victory comfortably.
Second-placed Atletico Madrid are eight points back after beating Valencia 3-1 in the evening game.
