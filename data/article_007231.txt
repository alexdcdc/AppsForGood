Owner Yorkshire Water has been looking for someone to tend to Humberstone Bank Farm, near Blubberhouses, after the previous tenant retired.
Along with the land, Jonathan Grayshon will maintain a cottage, several barns and about 400 ewes.
Mr Grayshon, from Dacre in Nidderdale, said: "Like a lot of young farmers trying to get on the farming ladder it is difficult to get hold of any land, and almost impossible within a ring fence or near where you live.
"Getting my own farm will be like living the dream."
Yorkshire Water said the new tenant will need to focus on "sustainable farming that protects water quality, wildlife biodiversity, peatland and carbon storage".
