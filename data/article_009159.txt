Campbell was killed instantly on Coniston Water when the craft flipped over while travelling at more than 300 MPH during a 1967 record attempt.
Divers recovered the wreckage in 2001 and it is now being restored.
About a third of the boat is being moved to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, where it will be shown in a wing dedicated to Campbell.
It includes two massive spars, originally clad in lightweight aluminium fairings to give Bluebird her sleek shape, which have been fully restored.
There are also replicas of the boat's four-metre long outer hulls, or sponsons, from the original drawings.
The originals were ripped away in the accident, and recovered floating but subsequently scrapped.
A team of volunteers at a workshop in North Shields will now fit the centre hull with its engines and systems.
Vicky Slowe, curator of the Ruskin Museum, said: "There's about one and a half tonnes of Bluebird going on show.
"We have a life-sized footprint of the Bluebird on the floor of the Bluebird wing, where the complete boat will go in due course, and the idea is to display these pieces on top of that so people can see how they fit together."
The parts will be fully reassembled at the Ruskin Museum and Bluebird will then be taken for a run on Coniston Water, before going on permanent display at the museum.
