A bear hunter based out of Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson in critical condition at Anchorage Providence after an accident above Carter Lake Saturday afternoon, according to Alaska State Troopers. 
  
 Soldotna Public Safety Communications Center received a distress signal via an in-reach device just after 12:00 Saturday afternoon. Two men, Zachary Tennyson, 19, and William McCormick, 28, both of JBER, shot a bear on a ridge above them. 
  
 The bear then rolled down the slope, dislodging rocks in the process. Troopers say McCormick was struck by both a rock and the falling bear. Tennyson was reportedly uninjured, but McCormick was hand carried to a LifeMed helicopter and transported to Anchorage Providence with life threatening injuries. 
  
 Alaska State Troopers, Bear Creek Fire Department, Moose Pass Volunteer Fire Department, and LifeMed all responded to the scene.
