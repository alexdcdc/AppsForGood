As the phone lines closed early on Saturday, the UK total stood at £46,624,259 and, locally, at £950,239.
Barra Best and Jo Scott presented the evening show in Titanic Belfast.
They linked up with the BBC One Children in Need live show to give updates on what was happening around Northern Ireland.
One of the highlights of the night saw 178 children from Northern Ireland joining thousands of others from across the UK to form a choir singing "Lean on Me".
The fun-packed BBC Children in Need evening on BBC One got underway at 19:30 GMT on Friday with Tess Daly and Greg James opening the fantastic night of entertainment.
Barra and Jo gave BBC Northern Ireland viewers a taste of the ingenious and inventive ways local people have been fundraising for this year's appeal and also looked at some of the many local groups that have been supported by BBC Children in Need.
Throughout the week, BBC Radio Ulster has supported the appeal. As part of this, Hugo Duncan and his team raised more than £18,000 towards this year's NI total through Hugo's on-air auction.
Barra, Jo and Pudsey will be back for BBC Children in Need: The Best Bits - a 70-minute special on BBC One Northern Ireland from 17:45 GMT giving viewers the chance to relive some of the highlights from Friday.
BBC Children in Need spends the money raised by the appeal to make a positive change to the lives of disadvantaged children and young people  in Northern Ireland and across the UK.
