Clucas, 25, joined Hull from League One side Chesterfield in July 2015 for a reported Â£1.3m.
He scored six goals in 52 appearances in all competitions last season as Hull won promotion from the Championship.
"The spirit in the squad is second-to-none and we are determined to achieve our goals in the Premier League this season," Clucas told the club website.
Clucas played for the first time in the Premier League last Saturday as Hull beat champions Leicester City 2-1.
