Police were called to the tower at 07:25 BST after reports banners had been put up half way up the south side.
The men, who gained access to the tower by dressing as builders, were protesting against the use of fracking. They came down about an hour later.
A 24-year-old from East Sussex and 63-year-old from Surrey were arrested.
Officers said they were being held on suspicion of criminal damage and being on enclosed premises.
Police said they believed the men taking part in the protest represented a website that campaigns against the use of fracking, a controversial extraction process which blasts water into rock to release gas.
Energy company Cuadrilla suspended fracking operations near Blackpool in June, over fears of a link to two minor earthquakes in the area.
The process has caused controversy in the US where some householders claim that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply causes tap water to ignite.
