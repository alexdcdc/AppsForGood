Every Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. for the past 23 years, 90–year-old Arnold Abbott has been feeding the homeless at a public beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
  
 On October 21, the City of Fort Lauderdale Commission passed an ordinance that banned public food sharing -- something that went into effect last week. Under the ordinance, organizations distributing food outdoors would have to provide portable toilets for use by workers and those being fed. 
  
 "We hope he feeds. He has a very valuable role in the community,” said Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler. "All we're saying is he can feed the next block over. He can feed at the church. We want them to be in safe secure settings. We wanted them to be in a sanitary matter. We them to have facilities available before and after." 
  
 On November 2, just days after the ordinance took effect, Abbott had handed out his third meal of the day when he was approached by police officers. He was cited for breaking the ordinance and given a notice that he must appear in court. 
  
 "One of the police officers said, 'Drop that plate right now,' as if I were carrying a weapon," Abbott told ABC affiliate WPLG.

 Abbott continued his tradition of feeding the homeless on a public beach Wednesday night when he was approached by officers again and his food operation was shut down. 
  
 But he plans on being back at the public beach, as usual, next Wednesday. 
  
 "I don’t plan to give up the beach,” he said. 
  
 The Fort Lauderdale Police told ABC News that Abbott will get his court subpoena in the mail and a judge will decide whether he will spend up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. 
  
 "Arnold thinks he can feed wherever he wants and the laws say differently. Despite the fact that he's a super nice guy and he's a gentleman and a kind soul we have to enforce the law,” Seiler said. 
  
 Although Abbott has been cited twice in less than a week, he has no plans to stop feeding the homeless, telling ABC News over the phone from his non-profit organization, Love Thy Neighbor, that the only alternative he has is to go to court. 
  
 Abbott sued the City of Fort Lauderdale in 1999 after they tried to stop him from feeding the homeless on a public beach. Abbott won the case three times in circuit court and twice in the court of appeals. 
  
 He was invited by a local church to feed the homeless in their parking lot this coming Sunday where he expects to feed up to 200 people. Abbott doesn’t believe he will receive any citations during this feed because he will be on private property. ||||| LIVE, THE ONE AND ONLY LOCAL 10 NEWS STARTS RIGHT NOW.

 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - 
  
 Local 10 first brought you the story of the 90-year-old man who was arrested for illegally feeding the homeless in Fort Lauderdale. Wednesday he was back to continue his cause. 
  
 VOTE: Do you agree with the Broward homeless feeding ordinance? 
  
 "We've heard from every continent," said Arnold Abbott. "The last I heard was from Kenya and Moscow." 
  
 Abbott has heard from hundreds of people all around the world since he and two pastors were charged Sunday with feeding the homeless in Fort Lauderdale. 
  
 "I've heard from South America, any number of people from Canada, three newspapers from the United Kingdom," Abbot said. 
  
 He was the first charged with the new ordinance that makes it a crime punishable by up to 60 days in jail to feed the homeless in public. The story first aired Local 10 has gone viral. 
  
 "I am both enthused and humbled," Abbot said. "The good news is that there is pressure being put on the city of Fort Lauderdale to do something about a law that is not only unfair, it's repressive." 
  
 Mayor Jack Seiler, who supports the ordinance, said he's gotten massive feedback as well, though not always so positive. But he said the law is meant to help the homeless, not to keep them from eating. 
  
 "Mr. Abbott has decided that he doesn't think these individuals should have to have any interaction with government, that they should be fed in the parks. We disagree," Seiler said. 
  
 But Abbott said there aren't adequate government services or food to deal with the homeless. 
  
 "What the city is doing by cutting out feeding is very simple -- they are forcing homeless people to go dumpster-diving all over again," Abbott said. "They will steal. That's what the mayor is forcing the homeless to do." 
  
 And while Abbott said he wants to compromise with the city, he expects to be charged again. 
  
 "I love the city. I live here, it's a beautiful place and I'd like to keep it beautiful, but you cannot sweep the homeless under a rug," he said. "There is no rug large enough for that." 
  
 Abbott and his team of chefs set up shop Wednesday night on Fort Lauderdale Beach and dished out free food to the homeless. Uniformed police were also there recording. 
  
 "They didn't have the gumption to move in on us. They were afraid, afraid of public opinion," said Abbott. 
  
 But Abbott was ultimately confronted by cops in the middle of an interview with Local 10 News. The elderly chef with a big heart was escorted away in front of a large crowd of his supporters. Instead of whisking the 90-year old to jail, police decided to just fingerprint Abbott and issue him a citation on the spot. 
  
 "It's a pubic safety issue. It's a public health issue," said Seiler. "The experts have all said that if you're going to feed them to get them from breakfast to lunch to dinner, all you're doing is enabling that cycle of homelessness. They don't interact with anyone, they don't receive the aid that they need." 
  
 "It's our right to feed people, it's our First Amendment right and I believe in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, and we should be allowed to feed our fellow man," Abbott said. 
  
 Abbott was asked if he would come back to the beach. 
  
 "You bet your life," Abbott replied. "I'll fight for the beach as long as there's birth in my body."
