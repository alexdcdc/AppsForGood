The Manchester United striker, 18, has scored on his debuts in the Premier League, Europa League, England's senior side and now the U21s.
But Rashford was not in Allardyce's first senior squad against Slovakia.
"I wasn't surprised in any way," said Southgate of Rashford's three goals in the 6-1 win against Norway on Tuesday.
"What we saw all week from him, we saw tonight. I couldn't have been happier with the way he approached everything.
"I'll speak to Sam in the next couple of days, I'm sure it's given him food for thought."
Rashford also scored on his full international debut against Australia in May, and netted the winner for United against Hull in his only Premier League appearance this season at the end of August.
Chelsea trio Nathaniel Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Lewis Baker also scored for England, in an impressive display at Colchester.
The comfortable win means Gareth Southgate's men are now two points clear of Switzerland at the top of their group, with two games left to play and a game in hand on their nearest opponents.
