 First, an anti-Christmas billboard was set up by the American Atheists outside a New Jersey entrance to the tunnel. 
  
 Now, the Catholic League has countered by putting up its own billboard near one of the tunnel's New York City entrances. 
  
 The atheist billboard says, "You know it's a myth. This season, celebrate reason!" The Catholic billboard counters: "You know it's real. This season, celebrate Jesus." 
  
 Both billboards will be up for at least the next couple of weeks. ||||| Thanks in part to the work of American Atheists, the number of atheists in the United States continues to grow and attitudes toward atheists are shifting. However, misconceptions about atheists still exist and members of our community still face discrimination at home, work, and school. Help us continue to elevate atheists and educate the public about atheism by making a tax-deductible gift today. |||||
