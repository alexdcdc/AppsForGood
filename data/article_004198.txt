His parents have told a local newspaper that he took his own life on Thursday at their home in Schenectady, New York.
The teenager wanted his yearbook portrait to show him holding his cat Mr Bigglesworth, with lasers in the background.
After he shared the photo online it went viral, however the school denied his request.
They did say they picture could appear somewhere in the Schenectady High School yearbook.
The school's head, Diane Wilkinson, also joined in with the meme and copied the pose with her dog, with the resulting photo designed to raise awareness for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and rescue animals.
"He made friends wherever he went," his father, Jonathan Stewart told the Times-Union of Albany.
"He had friends all over the country - people he'd met at youth-leadership conferences, online, just around town."
A private funeral is due to take place later this week.
