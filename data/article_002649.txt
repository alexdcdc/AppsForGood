 A picture of a mountain of about 300 Christmas presents bought by a mother for her family has gone viral after she posted it on Instagram. 
  
 Emma Tapping's 7ft (2.1 metre) tree appears almost hidden under the hundreds of gifts she has been wrapping since August. 
  
 The mother-of-three has bought her children up to 85 gifts each, including 30 for her 16-month-old baby. 
  
 She said people "shouldn't judge her spending". 
  
 After putting up her tree in November, Mrs Tapping, 35, who runs a holiday cottage on the Isle of Man, shared the picture on her Instagram online photo-sharing account, and it has since been shared 27,000 times. 
  
 She said: "I'm not 'insta-famous' - I've only got a couple of hundred followers and I didn't think anything of it. 
  
 "Someone took a screen shot - wrote a caption and it was blasted all over Facebook. 
  
 'It's my money' 
  
 "I only have 200 followers and it's been shared 27,000 times." 
  
 Mrs Tapping defended her decision to spend about £1,500 on her three children and wider family after receiving criticism on social media, with some labelling her "materialistic" and an "attention seeker". 
  
 She said the picture went viral without her knowledge and she has since appeared on ITV's This Morning programme to explain her spending, which started on 27 December last year. 
  
 Mrs Tapping said: "I didn't do it to brag and I only shared it with my friends and family. 
  
 "I'm not rich, I simply shop in a savvy way with vouchers and in sales. 
  
 "Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I am from a huge family and this is how we celebrate. 
  
 "It's my money. I'm not on benefits so it's how I choose to spend it. 
  
 "I don't want people to judge me. I shop all year around to put a smile on their faces.

 A generous mum-of-three who has bought over 300 Christmas presents for her family has slammed those who think she is spoiling her children. 
  
 Emma Tapping told This Morning that she was not rich despite the giant present mountain under her tree. 
  
 She claimed that the presents - around 85 each for her three children and husband - only cost around £1,500 in total using savvy Christmas shopping techniques. 
  
 Crediting January sales and bargain shopping throughout the year Emma explained to presenters Holly Willoughby and Ben Shephard her budget. 
  
 "No I'm to rich at all, which is the first thing I wanted to point out because it's been put all over the internet after it had been taken from Instagram that I was rich and I spoil my children. 
  
 "I literally start from January, I shop all the way through, I use every bargain that I can and every sale that I can. That's the way I do it, I shop all year round to make the pile as big as it is and start wrapping in August. 
  
 "All in all it's about £1,500 worth. I don't have a credit card. Martin money expert, I follow him religiously and I do all the sales. Anything full price I refuse to pay for." 
  
 When Emma shared a snap of her bulging Christmas tree on Instagram, she was slammed online by people who claimed she was 'abusing' her children. 
  
 The mum to two daughters aged 13 and nine and a son of 19 months, said she does the same every year and it's only because the image was shared so much have people paid attention. 
  
 Holly explained the reaction to Emma's post: "The other side to this, is you've had some very serious accusations that your children are suffering some form of abuse because they are being paid for their love in gifts and presents."

 Emma responded: "The way I see it is you could buy your kids two presents or 200 presents, it's the way you bring them up. 
  
 "You could buy your kids two presents and still have a little terror, my kids know the difference between right and wrong and they appreciate everything they get and they don't get spoilt throughout the year." 
  
 Strikingly different to Emma, was Jen Gale who buys her children second-hand Christmas presents and has even made a tree out of egg boxes and pom poms.

 The mum-of-two told Ben and Holly about her own Christmas: "It's very different. We're trying to focus on consuming less deliberately and concsiously. 
  
 "We're trying to make memories about the joy of Christmas and the time we spend together." 
  
 Thrifty Jen explained the family made their Christmas presents or sourced second-hand gifts from charity shops or eBay. 
  
 She confessed she knew there would be a day that would come when her children - who are seven and four - would want expensive technology and said it would be a path they crossed when it came.
