There were "a number" of coding errors in the National 5 question paper, according to a report by the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA).
It also found several typographical mistakes in the paper, which students sat in May.
The SQA said adjustments were made to the grade boundaries to make sure no candidates were affected by the errors.
Shortly after the exam was published, one teacher told BBC Scotland that the paper was a "disgrace".
But the SQA defended it, claiming it met course and assessment specifications and that the anecdotal feedback it had received was positive.
However a new report on the course said: "SQA acknowledges that there were a number of typographical and coding errors within the 2016 question paper.
"These were fully discussed at the grade boundary meeting and where these were found to impact on candidate performance, grade boundary adjustments were made.
"This ensures that no candidates were advantaged/disadvantaged by such errors."
Dr Gill Stewart, the SQA's director of qualifications development said: "As we do every year, we consider what went well in the most recent diet, and where improvements could be made for the future by SQA and the education system.
"Our course reports, which are provided for all subjects at all levels, also highlight ways in which recent exams and coursework may have differed from those of previous years.
"This is to ensure standards are maintained. We are committed to the continuous development and improvement of our qualifications and assessments for the benefit of all candidates."
