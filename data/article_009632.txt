Monday's alleged assault - involving a kettlebell, used for weight training - took place on the UCLA campus where the rapper's son is on the football team.
Nathalie Moar, who represents Diddy - real name Sean Combs - said reports of the incident were "wholly inaccurate".
"Actions... were solely defensive in nature to protect himself and his son."
Jail records show Combs was released on bail on Monday evening, after posting $160,000 (Â£101,000).
A statement from University Police did not identify the victim of the assault or say what led to the incident, but did confirm no-one was seriously injured.
"The various accounts of the event and charges that are being reported are wholly inaccurate," said Ms Moar.
"What we can say now is that any actions taken by Mr Combs were solely defensive in nature to protect himself and his son. We are confident that once the true facts are revealed, the case will be dismissed."
Combs' son Justin Combs is a redshirt junior defensive back on the UCLA football team, having played in just a handful of games in his three years with the team.
Snoop Dogg's son Cordell Broadus also plays on the same team.
In a statement from campus police, football coach Jim Mora called it "an unfortunate incident for all parties involved".
He added: "While UCPD continues to review this matter, we will let the legal process run its course and refrain from further comment at this time."
