The 55-year-old's death is being treated as 'unexplained' by police.
Police say they want to trace a woman who may have more information about how the victim came to sustain his head injuries.
They also asked for people in the Prince of Wales Avenue and Oxford Road area between 02:00 and 02:30 BST on Sunday to come forward.
The woman sought by police is described as mixed-race, 5ft 2ins (1.57m) tall, aged around 35, and slim with long wavy black hair.
