Wexford, one from bottom of the Premier Division, took a sixth-minute lead when Paul Murphy put Eric Molloy through to beat keeper Gerard Doherty.
Rory Patterson equalised with a deflected shot just before half-time.
Lucas Schubert put Derry ahead in the 67th minute and Barry McNamee wrapped up the victory.
Austrian Schubert pounced to net his third of the season after Aaron McEneff's free-kick had struck a post.
McNamee then advanced to shoot past home keeper Graham Doyle at the near post to make it 3-1.
Derry are now one match away from reaching the final for the 11th time, having won five and lost five of their 10 appearances in the showpiece occasion.
Elsewhere on Friday, Cork City beat Shamrock Rovers 5-0 in the quarter-final at Tallaght Stadium while Dundalk won 1-0 away to UCD.
