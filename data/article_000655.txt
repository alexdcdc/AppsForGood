Police called to Bramble Road in Witham, Essex, on Friday found a man had been burned on the face and hands.
A spokesman said they could not say which of two suspected attackers was in custody for "investigative reasons".
Last week police said they wanted to question two men about the attack and on Sunday released an e-fit.
Police said the 56-year-old victim had gone down to collect his post from the communal entrance to the block of flats when he encountered two men banging on the door.
A spokeswoman said it was now thought he was in "the wrong place at the wrong time" and "was not the intended target of this attack".
The victim is receiving treatment at the specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
"The two suspects are described as a white man and a black man and if anyone saw them either in the area prior to this attack or afterwards we would urgently like to speak to them," a spokeswoman said.
