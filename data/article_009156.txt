The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) is about to increase its involvement in the side, which has looked for new investors.
A 47-17 defeat by Glasgow Warriors in Scotland followed a 54-22 defeat at home to Leinster on 24 February.
"We need more depth, we need more investment, but have to be a lot better with the group we have," Jones said.
The Scottish side fielded 11 internationals in their starting 15, despite missing ten of Scotland's first-choice starting side, who were resting between Six Nations games.
When asked about the possibility of change in the boardroom, Jones said: "I've been waiting for positive news with regards to the Dragons going forward for a long time.
"But [chief executive] Stuart Davies is dealing with that, he keeps us informed as much as he can.
"The big picture for Newport Gwent Dragons is that we get more depth, more experience and not only in the playing staff.
"These are not excuses but going forward, I'd love to have more depth in the coaching. We've got two young coaches in Shaun [Connor] and Ceri [Jones] but we need additions everywhere."
The WRU has owned 50 percent of the team since just after its creation in 2003, but has not played an active role in its management.
For the second week running Jones watched his team's defence fall apart, conceding 47 points without reply at Scotstoun between the 30th and 78th minutes.
"It's been a poor ten days for the Dragons," admitted former Wales flanker Jones.
"Two weeks on the trot we've conceded a lot of points, there's issues around the defence but ultimately I think it's a mental one."
