Polling stations will be open until 22:00 GMT.
The two contests follow the resignations of Labour MPs Tristram Hunt, in Stoke-on-Trent Central, and Jamie Reed, in Copeland, in Cumbria.
Strong wind and rain are forecast in both constituencies as Storm Doris crosses central and northern parts of England.
Both sets of results are expected in the early hours of Friday.
