Sandra Spiers was discovered by police with her hands in front of her as if she was gripping a steering wheel.
The 44-year-old was banned from driving for a year and fined Â£300.
Spiers, from Boness, admitted driving on the A85 Perth to Crieff road on 13 April last year while unfit through drugs.
Depute fiscal Craig Donald told Perth Sheriff Court that police officers on patrol saw Spiers at about 21:50.
Mr Donald said: "They spotted the accused sitting on the pavement with her hands in the driving position.
"When she was spoken to by the officers she appeared to be under the influence of a substance as she was not making eye contact and was falling asleep.
"She was asked to identify the driver of the vehicle which was situated nearby.
"She replied it was her and then provided a negative alcohol blood sample at the roadside."
After being taken into custody, Spiers was examined by a police doctor, who formed the opinion that she was under the influence of a substance.
Mr Donald said: "It is accepted on behalf of the Crown that the medication the accused was under the influence of was prescription, rather than any illicit medication."
Kirsty Lumsden, defending, said her client had been taking medication after the death of a close family member about four weeks before the incident.
"It is accepted that unfortunately, on the day in question, she was sleep deprived and through her grief had not eaten properly or perhaps not taken enough fluids to hydrate herself," Ms Lumsden said.
"Perhaps owing to these factors the medication she was taking had a more considerable effect on her system.
"On this particular occasion she was unfit to drive her vehicle.
"She accepts entirely her responsibility for her actions."
