The pair, who took over from Ian Davies in the summer, have agreed to stay at the Mennaye until May 2019.
Both had long playing careers with the club and were assistants to Davies before taking over after cost cuts forced him to leave.
The Pirates have also brought in former England forward and Nottingham coach Martin Haag on a part-time basis.
Paver and Cattle have led the Pirates to fifth place in the Championship this season, one point off the play-off places.
"We've been very fortunate to have a chance to come straight out of playing and coach at Championship level," Cattle told BBC Sport.
"I think we've made a made a decent fist of it this year, there's been a lot of off-pitch matters that gave us that opportunity, but we're chuffed that the board have given us the chance."
The pair were teammates for over a decade and Cattle says the friendship they built up in that time makes it easy to organise their roles in joint-charge.
"If you don't agree with something you can be open and honest and if you don't have that relationship you might have to tiptoe around a topic," he added.
"Working with him is pretty easy, we're two different characters and in terms of our coaching approach, we know how each other works and know when to step away, and we have a good relationship off the pitch as well."
