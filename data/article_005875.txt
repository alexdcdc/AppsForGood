The 28-year-old was capped three times by Scotland in 2014 but has only started two games for Pro12 outfit Glasgow this season.
Ealing director of rugby Ben Ward said: "He has a big battle on his hands with Luke Carter for the number nine shirt.
"And I'm looking forward to seeing them work together and push each other and the team forward."
Hart, who was born in New Zealand but qualifies for Scotland through a grandmother, moved from Australian Super Rugby outfit Waratahs to join Edinburgh in 2013.
He switched to Pro12 rivals Glasgow two years later but has found himself third choice behind current Scotland internationals Henry Pyrgos and Ali Price this season and spent some time farmed out to Ayr in the Scottish Premiership.
Hart will team up at Ealing with former Warriors team-mate Rory Clegg, the fly-half who moved to the West London outfit in February.
"Grayson already has a good relationship with one of our half backs and that can help bed him in quickly," Ward told his club website.
"He will bring a huge amount of experience and is used to playing on a 3G pitch with Glasgow.
"We spoke numerous times prior to him joining and it was clear that he still harbours huge ambitions within the game and that was really important from our point of view."
Ealing presently sit third in the English Championship and Hart is hoping to help them reach a higher level.
"It is such an exciting time to be joining the Ealing Trailfinders as they are playing some excellent rugby and I want to help the club continue to grow," said the scrum-half.
"I want to contribute to the club on and off the field as best as I possibly can and keep developing as a player and a person."
