The venue was due to host the start of the series on Saturday.
Seven Merthyr players suffered friction burns from the 3G Sardis Road surface in their National Cup semi-final against RGC 1404.
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) later opened an investigation into the pitch.
A WRU statement said: "It has been agreed with Pontypridd RFC that it would be played elsewhere in order to ensure testing on the surface is as thorough as possible."
"We completely respect Pontypridd's diligence regarding the matter and appreciate their co-operation in moving the fixtures for day one," said Gethin Watts, Age Grade Manager of the Welsh Rugby Union.
"It's a pity we won't be taking the series to Pontypridd this year, but we're now looking forward to hosting three exciting games at nearby Taffs Well and the BT Sport Cardiff Arms Park."
The tournament involves Wales, England, Canada, Ireland, Italy and Scotland with matches also being played at Parc y Scarlets and Ystrad Mynach on 12 April and 16 April.
