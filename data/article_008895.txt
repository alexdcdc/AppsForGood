These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.The goal is to fix all broken links on the web .

 It was a simple plan: A college student would crawl through an air duct at a building housing an instructor’s office in the wee hours, lower himself from the ceiling and, with the help of a cohort, steal a copy of the final exam for a statistics class. 
  
 But the odds were never in their favor. 
  
 The instructor at the University of Kentucky, who was working very late, had gone out for a midnight meal and returned just in time to derail the plan, according to a university spokesman. 
  
 The episode unfolded around 2 a.m. on Wednesday at the university’s campus in Lexington, Ky., the spokesman Jay Blanton, said. 
  
 One of the students, Henry Lynch II, had made his way through the duct — a distance of less than 10 feet — to the third-floor office of the instructor, John P. Cain, Mr. Blanton said. Mr. Lynch made his way from the ceiling and lowered himself the eight feet to the floor.

 Mr. Blanton noted the office had file cabinets and other furniture that could serve as footholds to help the climb down from the drop ceiling, but it was not clear how or where Mr. Lynch gained access to the duct. |||||
