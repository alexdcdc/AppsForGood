The union's members, including police community support officers, are unhappy with a 1% pay rise offer, and are calling for a 3% wage increase.
Up to 30,000 of Unison's members could be involved in the strike.
The dispute also involves 999 call takers, scenes of crime officers and fingerprint experts.
In December Unison suspended a planned strike to allow for further talks between the union and employers, but deadlock remains.
The union said police staff have faced a pay freeze or below inflation pay rises for the past three years.
Unison national officer Ben Priestley described industrial action as a "last resort", and said he was "hopeful" the dispute would be resolved and a strike avoided.
"The rules around industrial action mean we have had to call another strike day to ensure we are still able to take strike action should the talks break down," he added.
When Unison members were balloted for strike action last year 60% voted in favour.
