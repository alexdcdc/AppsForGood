Pte Matthew Boyd, 20, was off-duty in the barracks town of Brecon, Powys, when he was attacked by Jake Vallely.
His friend Aaeron Evans, 23, has denied taking part in the fight by assisting or encouraging 24-year-old Mr Vallely.
Mr Vallely, of Brecon, denies murder and Mr Evans, also of Brecon, denies manslaughter at Cardiff Crown Court.
Pte Boyd, who served with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, had been on his way back to his barracks before he was found unconscious by police in the early hours of 15 May.
The prosecution claims Mr Evans was present when an argument broke out between Mr Vallely and Pte Boyd outside The Cellar Bar.
It is claimed the pair then chased Pte Boyd down the street and Mr Evans remained present when Mr Vallely assaulted him.
But Vincent Coughlin QC, summing up his defence case for Mr Evans, said his client left before the fight started.
He said CCTV footage of the events leading up to the fight showed Mr Evans was trying to discourage Mr Vallely from getting involved in an argument with Pte Boyd.
He said Mr Evans pushed his friend away and told him to "walk away".
Mr Coughlin QC said this was accepted by Mr Vallely who, during cross examination, agreed Pte Boyd had died as a result of a one-to-one fight with him and Mr Evans was not present at the time.
Mr Coughlin QC told the jury Mr Vallely said Mr Evans did not know about the fight until he told him about it later.
The trial continues.
