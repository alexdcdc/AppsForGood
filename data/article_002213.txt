The 27-year-old had been adamant he would leave the club to be nearer to his two daughters in Argentina.
But a source close to the player told BBC Sport: "It will be impossible for Carlos to leave and he knows that."
He added that Inter Milan had made an offer for the striker, but it had fallen short of City's valuation.
The summer transfer window closes at 2300 BST on Wednesday.
Staying at Eastlands will mark something of a comedown for Tevez, who released a statement in July making clear his desire to leave City for family reasons.
A few weeks later, City thought they had agreed a deal with Corinthians for the sale of the striker, only for the Sao Paulo-based outfit to pull out because they could not finalise the transfer before the close of their international transfer window.
Inter Milan have also been consistently linked with the player, but instead opted for Atletico Madrid's Diego Forlan to replace Samuel Eto'o.
A combination of the fee wanted by City for Tevez and the player's salary demands seem to have warded off potential suitors.
Tevez is yet to start a game for City this season, with Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko preferred in attack by manager Roberto Mancini.
The forward has also lost the club captaincy to Vincent Kompany, while his place in the Argentina national side has again been taken by Aguero.
Tevez signed a five-year deal with City in July 2009, having moved to the club from Manchester United.
He submitted a transfer request last December, before withdrawing it and helping City finish third in the Premier League table.
