Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the south Wales, Dyfed-Powys and north Wales forces all "required improvement".

Responding to Tuesday's review, Gwent's police and crime commissioner Ian Johnston said: "This report is very good news and a fantastic turnaround when you consider the criticism the force took a few years ago, how it was graded in this area and the challenging financial climate we have had to work in."
HM Inspector Wendy Williams said the force had made good progress and domestic abuse was now a clear priority.
However, South Wales Police Ass Ch Con Nikki Holland said she was disappointed by the report.
"The report looks at procedures and practices that were in place at the time of the inspection but doesn't take into account the good work that the force and the commissioner's team had already started, which addresses a lot of the suggestions for improvement," she added.
A Dyfed-Powys spokesman said: "We are delighted that the inspectorate recognised that Dyfed-Powys Police has a strong ethic to protect the vulnerable, with good support from partners.
"The force has already commenced work in relation to the identified areas for improvement."
North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Winston Roddick said the force, which was told it could do more to tackle child sex abuse, had set up a victim help centre and had employed experts to support people affected by child sexual exploitation.
