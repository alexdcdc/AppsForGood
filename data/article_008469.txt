Duncan Enright thought he had been defeated by Conservative Suzanne Bartington in Witney East, tweeting: "Thanks for the opportunity to serve".
But after a recount he told followers: "Actually I won! Bundle of votes found under a Tory pile! Delighted!"
The Tories maintained their majority of 33 in West Oxfordshire, while Labour held on to Oxford City Council.
Labour took two seats off the Greens to increase its hold in Oxford, where it now has a majority of 20.
After the result, Mr Enright tweeted: "Would you believe it? Thank you to all my neighbours!"
He said: "It was my fault really. I think I jumped the gun in announcing my defeat, because there was a pile of votes which were all for me with the Conservative one on top."
Mr Enright added that he was "delighted and proud and humbled" to have been re-elected.
In 2015 he stood as a parliamentary candidate in Oxfordshire's Witney constituency and came second to David Cameron.
Conservative Harry St John was elected to the North Leigh ward after former council leader and election agent for the prime minister Sir Barry Norton stood down.
He said he was excited to have been successful and added: "I hope I will be able to do as well as Barry Norton has done over the last 30 years."
