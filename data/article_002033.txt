The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said its investigation had reached a "critical and significant stage" and "serious allegations" had been raised "against a large number of officers and staff throughout Bedfordshire Police".
Of the 15 people being investigated, 10 are retired or no longer serving with a police force, two are working for other police forces and three remain at Bedfordshire - one of these three is a serving police officer the other two are police staff.
The original investigation involved 10 officers and staff but has been widened to include more people.
Deputy Chief Constable Mike Colbourne said referring the matter to the IPCC was "only right".
"We will not tolerate any type of discrimination and work hard to ensure our workforce treats each other and members of the public with dignity and respect in line with the policing code of ethics at all times," he said.
