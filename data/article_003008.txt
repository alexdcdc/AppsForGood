The Museum of Orange Heritage will allow visitors to learn more about the roots and history of Orangeism in Ireland and around the world.
The museum was part-funded by Â£3.6m of EU peace-fund money.
Dr David Hume of the Orange Order said he wanted to give people a "better, more informed view of who we are".
"We, in turn, will have a better, more informed view of their opinions," he added.
Charles Thomas Hall, an Orangeman from Connecticut in the United States, was the first visitor to the new museum.
Visitors will be able to learn about Orange symbols and regalia, play instruments, and listen to different types of band music.
A collarette belonging to former Manchester United and Northern Ireland footballer George Best when he was in the junior Royal Black Institution is on display.
A roll of honour of famous members of the Orange details the history of people, like Dr Thomas Barnardo, whose philanthropic work led to the foundation of children's charity Barnardos.
Dr Hume said the museum aims to promote reconciliation through education, and there was a desire to "challenge people in terms of their perceptions of Orangeism".
"We want anybody who wants to come in here," he said.
"We have a very strong engagement with the maintained school sector, we definitely want children from that sector to be here and to learn about our traditions.
"We also want pupils from the state sector to be here because we feel there's a deficit there in terms of their understanding and knowledge."
