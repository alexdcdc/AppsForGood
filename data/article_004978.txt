State media said the Malaysian envoy would leave within 48 hours.
Malaysia has already expelled North Korea's ambassador, after he said North Korea could not trust Malaysia's inquiry into Mr Kim's death.
Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was killed with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur airport last month.
Malaysia has not directly blamed North Korea for the attack, in which two women smeared VX nerve agent on Mr Kim's face. But there is widespread suspicion Pyongyang was responsible.
North Korea's latest move is seen as retaliation for Malaysia's decision to expel Pyongyang's ambassador.
Malaysia had already recalled its ambassador to Pyongyang for "consultations".
Malaysia's foreign ministry said it had demanded, but not received, an apology from North Korean ambassador Kang Chol after he criticised Malaysia's investigation into the death.
Mr Kang has accused Malaysia of conducting a "pre-targeted" investigation and of conducting an autopsy on Mr Kim without North Korean consent or any representative from the North Korean embassy being present.
Malaysia was one of very few countries that had relatively friendly relations with North Korea.
It cancelled visa-free travel for visiting North Koreans in the wake of the killing, citing security reasons.
Investigators are seeking to question several North Koreans, including an embassy official, over the death of Kim Jong-nam.
Two women, one from Vietnam and another from Indonesia, have been charged with murder. They both said they thought they were taking part in a TV prank but are yet to make a formal plea in their case.
Malaysia's government has also announced an investigation into a company called Glocom, which has been operating in the country for several years.
According to a confidential UN report, Glocom is run by North Korea's top intelligence agency to sell military communications equipment, in violation of UN sanctions.
