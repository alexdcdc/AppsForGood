Jay Brenton Liptrot, 43, owned the property in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, where five people died in October 2012.
Lee-Ann Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their son Charlie, 15 months, Ms Shiers' nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two, died in the fire.
Mr Liptrot, of Prestatyn, did not enter a plea when he appeared at the town's magistrates' court on Friday.
Melanie Smith has already been jailed for at least 30 years for five counts of murder after starting the fire in a row over a shared hallway.
Mr Liptrot will appear at Mold Crown Court in May.
