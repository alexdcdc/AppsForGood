Lee McAllister - known as the Aberdeen Assassin - was the first Scot to hold two Commonwealth titles at different weights at the same time.
McAllister - who announced his retirement in 2013 - broke a man's jaw in a takeaway in July.
He was jailed for nine months after he admitted the assault at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
