Ryan Bevington takes over from prop James with Sam Parry replacing Baldwin.
Hooker Matthew Rees is suspended while Rhys Patchell has not recovered from concussion.
Jarrod Evans, 19, makes his first Pro12 Blues start to cover Patchell's absence and Sam Warburton is back at open-side after illness.
James has a calf injury and Baldwin a shoulder problem in the wake of Ospreys' European Champions Cup defeat by Clermont Auvergne.
Ospreys' Fiji centre Josh Matavesi has failed to pass a head injury assessment and misses the encounter.
Blues captain Josh Navidi, centre Cory Allen, utility back Gareth Anscombe and flanker Ellis Jenkins were all ruled out by injury.
Ospreys' casualty list also includes Wales internationals Rhys Webb, Gareth Delve, Ashley Beck and Dafydd Howells,
Both regions have made poor starts to their domestic season, each winning only twice in seven games.
All those wins - for both regions - have come against Italian opposition.
However, Ospreys were impressive in gaining two bonus points in Clermont, scoring four tries in the process, and are likely to start as favourites.
