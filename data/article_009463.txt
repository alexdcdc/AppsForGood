"We are talking here about one of the best players in the world," Real Madrid icon Emilio Butragueno says of a 26-year-old who is key to club then country this summer.
Real Madrid chase an 11th European Cup at the San Siro Stadium in Milan on Saturday where Bale scored a dazzling Champions League hat-trick for Tottenham in 2010.
A year before the Champions League final comes to Bale's home-town of Cardiff, the Welshman stands 90 minutes away from a second European triumph for Real - but Wales will watch nervously as their talisman is integral to Chris Coleman's Euro 2016 hopes.
Four goals and a man down after just 35 minutes on a clear October night in Milan, Tottenham had quite the task ahead of them in their debut Champions League campaign against Europe's champions.
But then Bale switched to another gear and forced Harry Redknapp's side back into contention.
His first goal came from a sensational 50-yard run down the left flank and a stunning finish from an angle past Julio Cesar.
His next came when he left veteran Javier Zanetti in the dust to score again with an almost identical goal, before capping off his hat-trick in injury time.
"Five more minutes and we would have drawn," his then Spurs manager Harry Redknapp told BBC Wales Sport's Gareth Bale documentary.
Then a 21-year-old, Bale had arrived on the world scene in stunning fashion.
Bale's heroics as Tottenham reached the quarter-final of the Champions League, only to lose, ironically, to Real, set the stage for him to become Spurs' star man and PFA Footballer of the Year before a world record £85m move to Madrid.
"He's playing with better players now, in what is technically the best league in Europe and he has the expectation on his shoulders," said former Spurs team-mate Jermaine Jenas.
"The art of winning things at a big club, when the expectation is there, that's something that helps your development."
He scored decisive goals in the 2014 Copa del Rey and Champions League finals to help Madrid to 'la decima' - a 10th European Cup title - in his first season in Spain but the notoriously tough Bernabeu crowd turned on the Welshman in a difficult second season as rumours swirled of a Premier League return.
"Because Gareth is such a great lad, I always had that worry that he would be in the shadow of Ronaldo, whether he would feel over-powered by him," explained Redknapp.
"But I thought Gareth coped great with it and has done really well. The Madrid fans can be critical, that's how it is there and players are going to come under fire if they have the slightest hiccup, but Gareth has come through that well."
Real legend Butragueno, who spearheaded the Spanish attack at the 1986 and 1990 World Cups, feels Bale has now won over the notoriously tough-to-please Madrid fans.
"Truly, he's an extraordinary player who is very committed and for us he's an essential player," Butragueno said.
"Here at Real Madrid, we play every game like it is a final. It is like an exam and our fans are very demanding because they are used to winning and seeing extraordinary players.
"Therefore we could say the Bernabeu is like a courtroom where they know a lot about football and the level of demand is very high.
"He has been with us for three years and we hope he will stay for many more. We are confident he will be a fundamental player for us over the coming years and will leave a lasting legacy at the club," he said.
"We consider ourselves very lucky to be able to count on a player like him. We are very happy and at the same time very excited about the future of Gareth at Real Madrid.
Bale has been a vital part of the Wales squad in the build up to this summer's European Championships as Chris Coleman's side reached their first major international tournament for 58 years.
He scored seven of Wales' 11 goals in qualifying to steer Wales to a second-placed finish in Group B.
Carlo Ancelotti, his former manager at Real Madrid, believes Wales will be able to draw upon Bale's experience in Spain during the Euros.
"Bale already helped his team from his experience in Madrid because he did really well in qualifications for the Euros," Ancelotti told BBC Wales Sport.
"For Wales it will be more competitive than for teams like France, Spain or Germany but I think Bale can be fantastic."
