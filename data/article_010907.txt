The Exiles face Darren Ferguson's side at the Keepmoat Stadium on Saturday with Rovers having not lost at home this term.
"He's got a fantastic team and they are one of the biggest hitters in the league," Feeney told BBC Wales Sport.
"It's going to be tough as they've got some fantastic players but we've got to be confident in our own ability."
Rovers are fourth in League Two while Newport have won just once on the road in all competitions this season and Feeney knows the task ahead of his side.
"We know it's going to be a very big ask. They're a fantastic club. Not long ago they were in the Championship," he continued.
"It's a great game for us to go into it's one that we can go into and play to our strengths."
Summer signing Jon Parkin scored twice in Newport's 2-2 draw against Cheltenham Town and Feeney thinks the 34-year-old has answered his critics.
"People questioned me when I signed him in the summer as he's 34 and been playing in non-league and they talk about his size but he was that size when he played in the Premier League," Feeney added.
"He's a big morale booster and not just on the pitch but he's fantastic for the team. He's great around the place, he's bubbly but he works hard."
