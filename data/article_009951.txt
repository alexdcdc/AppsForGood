Speaking at a fundraiser, she said they were "racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic  - you name it".
She then went on to say the rest of the Republican nominee's supporters were "just desperate for change".
Mr Trump's campaign manager said Mrs Clinton had insulted "millions of Americans", with her comments.
Polls released earlier this week suggest Mr Trump is gaining on Mrs Clinton, and the rivals are neck-and-neck in the key battleground states of Ohio and Florida.
In other developments:
Mrs Clinton's comments about her opponent's supporters were made at an LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) fundraiser in New York.
"To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the 'basket of deplorables'. Unfortunately there are people like that, and he has lifted them up," she said.
But she said the other half of his supporters were individuals who felt let down by the economy and government and were desperate for change.
"They don't buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. Those are people we have to understand and empathise with as well."
Her campaign manager tweeted to say the "deplorables" she referred to were the Alt-Right - a far right, mainly online, group who critics accuse of being bigoted white nationalists.
But Mr Trump's campaign manager felt it was a jibe at many others:
Singer Barbara Streisand performed at the fundraiser, with a version of Stephen Sondheim's song Send in the Clowns, parodying Mr Trump.
