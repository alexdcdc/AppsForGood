Fifteen kilograms of the drug were discovered in a haulage vehicle that had just arrived at Dublin Port from the UK.
It followed a joint operation between the Revenue Commissioners Customs Service and the police.
A 36-year-old man was arrested and has been charged with drug trafficking offences.
He remains in custody and will appear in a Dublin court on Monday morning.
