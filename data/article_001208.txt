John Cryer said in a letter to MPs that the party leadership had not told him or sacked chief whip Rosie Winterton about the changes.
The PLP had held talks with party leaders over shadow cabinet elections.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was willing to continue the discussions.
His reshuffle has seen deputy leader Tom Watson appointed shadow culture secretary, as well as the return of several MPs who quit the shadow cabinet in the summer in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership.
In other appointments, Jon Ashworth became shadow health secretary, John Healey returned to housing and Diane Abbott became shadow home secretary.
In his letter, Mr Cryer mentioned how, in early September, the PLP voted "overwhelmingly" for the return of elections to the shadow cabinet.
"This led to negotiations involving myself and the then chief whip, Rosie Winterton, and people from the leadership team.
"As far as Rosie and I were concerned, the talks were held in good faith with the aim of striking an agreement which would allow some places to be filled through elections while the leader would retain the right to appoint others."
Mr Cryer said it then became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was under way, which "had not been discussed or mentioned" during the talks.
"It now seems to me that the party's leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way," he added. "Obviously, I deeply regret this turn of events."
The spokesman for Mr Corbyn, who was re-elected as leader last weekend following a challenge by Owen Smith, said: "Shadow cabinet elections will be considered by Labour's national executive committee as part of a wider party democratisation at a special meeting next month."
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says that while some of Mr Corbyn's critics have been welcomed back to the front bench, very few of his allies have departed.
The Labour leader's hold on his party's levers of power is firmer than ever, he adds.
