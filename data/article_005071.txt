Wasps' Hughes replaces the injured Billy Vunipola at number eight, while Harlequins' Marland Yarde will start on the wing in place of the suspended Elliot Daly.
Daly is banned after being sent off in last weekend's victory over Argentina.
Winger Semesa Rokoduguni and lock Dave Attwood do not make the 23-man squad.
The victory over Argentina was England's 13th in a row and their 12th under Australian Jones, and a win over Australia in the final autumn international would equal their longest winning run, set across 2002 and 2003.
