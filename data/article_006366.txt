Last year, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service announced plans to save £5m by 2020 and cut more than 300 posts in a bid to tackle its £12m deficit.
But after a public consultation fire chiefs have scaled down cuts to £4.1m.
The number of full-sized fire engines will still be reduced from 76 to 25, with smaller "intermediate and first response" vehicles replacing them.
Original plans would have seen 86 full-time firefighters and 225 retained staff - firefighters who only respond to emergency calls - lose their jobs.
But now only 60 full-time and 152 retained posts could be lost.
Chief fire officer Dave Curry said: "We're in a financial position where we can actually make adjustments to our original proposals."
Investing in new equipment which requires less maintenance and fewer staff is part of the plans.
The Fire Brigades Union has welcomed the reformed proposals but has asked for Hampshire Fire and Rescue to ensure a minimum of four firefighters are on each fire engine.
Mr Curry added: "We do need to save substantial amounts of money, the same as any public service."
The cuts need to be approved by the Fire Authority before they can be implemented.
