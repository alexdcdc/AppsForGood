Cole, who is partnered with singer Anastacia this year, said he is still recovering from a chest infection.
Speaking on Strictly spin-off It Takes Two, Cole said his doctor has advised him to rest until the end of the week.
He told presenter Zoe Ball: "I'll let you into a little secret. We have the lovely Gorka stepping in for me for a few days."
Cole is still currently scheduled to dance with Anastacia on the live show this weekend.
The pair are due to perform a quickstep to Frank Sinatra's My Kind of Town, a routine that has been choreographed by Cole.
Asked when he would be well enough to dance again, Cole replied: "[The doctor] said take off until Thursday or Friday at least, and then we'll see."
Marquez left the competition earlier this month after he and his partner Tameka Empson were voted out.
Speaking about being replaced by Marquez in rehearsals, Cole joked: "I don't know how happy I am about it, he's Spanish, he's good looking, and he's got a body that's pretty much the best on the show."
At the weekend, Cole revealed he had to make an overnight visit to the hospital hours before Saturday's Strictly performance.
He tweeted: "Had to take myself to A&E as I couldn't breathe very well so not enough oxygen getting through."
He added: "#NHS Doc's, Nurses & staff are phenomenal. Thank you for looking after me in the wee hours. Lung infection now under control so thank you."
