There were one million spectators at the race with about one in five from outside Yorkshire, said Welcome to Yorkshire. Some of those attended more than one day of the event, boosting the overall figure.
The new race was set up after the successful Tour de France Grand Depart was held in Yorkshire during 2014.
Those scenes prompted the tour's race director Christian Prudhomme to describe 2014 as the "grandest Grand Depart".
Spending by all spectators at the Tour de Yorkshire amounted to Â£49,711,436 and the average stay for visitors from outside the county was two and half nights, according to the survey of the race.
The total included accommodation costs and spending on items such as food, drink, transport and souvenirs.
The survey was conducted by independent research agency GRASP, using 1,500 respondents who were questioned at a race stage or online.
The data was analysed by Leeds Beckett University.
