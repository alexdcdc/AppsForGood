The rules state that the Organising Committee could replace a team with the opponent it eliminated.
However, Senegal (Women) and Burundi (Men) decided not to take up a spot because of the short notice period.
It means both the men's and women's competition will have one group of three teams and one group of four.
Women
Group A - Congo, Nigeria, Tanzania, Cote d'Ivoire
Group B - Cameroon, Ghana, South Africa
Men
Group A - Congo, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso
Group B - Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria.
