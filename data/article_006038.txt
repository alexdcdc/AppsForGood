The incident happened on a footpath at the rear of Inverkip Drive, Dykehead, between 08:45 and 09:00 on Wednesday.
The girl kicked the man and managed to run off. She was uninjured but left badly shaken by the incident.
Police said the man ran off in the direction of Dyfrig Street. He was white, aged between 18 and 23, about 5ft 7in and slim.
He was wearing a black jacket and black trousers - possibly jogging trousers - and a black beanie hat.
Police have been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and reviewing CCTV footage.
Det Insp Kenny Dalrymple said: "It's imperative we locate this man and I am appealing to people in the local community to consider if they heard or saw something.
"At that time of the morning, people may have been getting ready to go out, perhaps to buy newspapers, take children to school or make their way to work, so you may have noticed something unusual or you may have seen the suspect running off.
"If you have any information, please do contact us and pass it on.
"I'm aware that this matter will be of concern to local people and I would like to reassure everyone that additional police officers will be on patrol in the area and anyone with any concerns can speak to these officers."
