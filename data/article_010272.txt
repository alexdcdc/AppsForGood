The energy in the world's most famous room changes instantly and perceptibly as he sits down. 
  
 It's a little after 3 in the afternoon. Trump says he already has been up and working for 12 hours. He and first lady Melania Trump have met with Argentine President Mauricio Macri and his wife, Juliana Awada. 
  
 He has signed an executive order, creating an office to protect Veterans Affairs Department whistleblowers. Then he signed another, ordering an investigation of the relationship between aluminum imports and national security. 
  
 Staffers walk briskly in and out of the complex of offices; a line of journalists fills a hallway, waiting to interview the president. 
  
 His daughter Ivanka, perhaps his most trusted adviser, has just departed. 
  
 Now, as an exclusive conversation with the Washington Examiner begins, the words, the tone, the messages are vintage Trump: All the familiar superlatives, the choppy sentences, the insistence that his first 100 days have been the best of any president. 
  
 Over the next 40 minutes, he jumps, in classic Trump fashion, over a range of topics, from his relations with foreign leaders to the danger of North Korea, from the election last year to his hopes for America tomorrow. 
  
 Yet listen closely, especially when he speaks about decisions involving life and death, and you sense that sitting here, in the Oval Office, as the 45th president has humbled even Donald J. Trump. 
  
 "You can make a mistake in deals, and you work it out," he explains at one point. "You make a mistake here, there is nothing to work out. You know it's trouble. It could be big trouble. And it is life-threatening trouble for lots of people, potentially." 
  
 A portrait of Thomas Jefferson hangs to his right, one of Andrew Jackson, perhaps his favorite president, is to his left. A bust of a sober-looking Abraham Lincoln sits beneath Jefferson, while Trump's father smiles broadly from a black-and-white photo behind the Resolute Desk, given by Queen Victoria in 1880 to Rutherford B. Hayes and used by many presidents since. 
  
 "It's a very intensive process," he says of the presidency. "Really intense. I get up to bed late and I get up early." He rarely sleeps more than four hours, which is good, he explains, because he can call leaders around the world in the dark hours while the rest of Washington sleeps. 
  
 "When I was doing many real estate deals at one time, I always thought that was going to be more comprehensive and lengthier than a day like this. 
  
 "It's not." 
  
 So far into his presidency, as with so many modern-era presidents before him, much of his focus has been on challenges from abroad. 
  
 Freeing a prisoner

 Last week, the Trump administration flew Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker, home to the United States after negotiating her release from a three-year captivity in Egypt. 
  
 Trump felt strongly about achieving Hijazi's release, he says, when he met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi in April in the Oval Office. 
  
 "As you know, President Obama tried to have Aya released for three and a half years," he says. "They were unsuccessful. I was with President el-Sissi for 10 minutes. During that 10-minute session, I said it would be a great honor for this country and I think it would be a very positive step if Aya were released." 
  
 Trump explains that Sissi replied, "I would like to consider that," to which Trump responded that he considered the issue "really very" important. 
  
 "And he was so great. He not only released Aya, he released her husband, and he released eight people total ... I thought it was fantastic." 
  
 Sissi, he concludes, is a good man: "I know that he didn't like President Obama, and I know President Obama did not like him. But I do like him. And I thought it was a great and brilliant gesture. 
  
 "And I very much appreciated it. She would have been in jail for 28 years. She is a young person. She is a good person. She is a totally innocent person." 
  
 Hijazi, a graduate of George Mason University in Virginia, was arrested in 2014 with her husband, Mohamed Hassanein. Both worked at Beladi Foundation, which she founded to care for homeless children in Cairo. 
  
 A smiling Hijazi visited the president at the White House after her release last week. 
  
 A legitimate 'red line' 
  
 Trump authorized the U.S. Navy to fire 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles against Syria in April after the regime of Bashar Assad attacked civilians with chemical weapons. 
  
 In sharp contrast, Trump authorized the U.S. Navy to fire 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles against Syria in April after the regime of Bashar Assad attacked civilians with chemical weapons. 
  
 It was, he admits, his toughest decision so far. 
  
 "I legitimized President Obama's red line in the sand," he says. "Which we had to do. I mean, somebody had to do it." 
  
 Nevertheless, it was, he says, an incredibly difficult moment: "First of all, it is a hard decision. You don't know what is going to happen," once the missiles are fired. "Is one of them going to go haywire and end up in a city or in a town and kill a lot of people? 
  
 "But it was an important decision. Not an easy decision to make. Because you know, when you say 'yes,' there is death. 
  
 "And death is very tough. Very tough. There is a lot of weight on this kind of decision." 
  
 A 'tipping point' in North Korea 
  
 If his Syria decision was "tough," those yet to be made on North Korea and its nuclear weapons sound absolutely nightmarish. 
  
 Trump hopes for a diplomatic solution, he says, while bracing himself for something worse. 
  
 Trump describes North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as "very threatening ... saying terrible things. And people can't do that." 
  
 "North Korea weighs on me, but we have to be prepared for the worst," he says. "We have to be prepared to do what we have to do. We cannot allow this to go on." 
  
 He describes North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as "very threatening ... saying terrible things. And people can't do that." 
  
 On the other hand, he has nothing but praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping, especially Xi's efforts to prevent conflict involving its erstwhile ally, North Korea. 
  
 Trump says he has pressed the Chinese leader to use his influence to halt any further North Korean tests of nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles that could, one day, threaten the United States. 
  
 Clearly, he sees Xi as a friend and an asset when it comes to dealing with North Korea. Yet, the relationship sounds deeper, more personal, too — a stark contrast with the presidential campaign, when he frequently cited China as a currency-manipulating rival. 
  
 His meeting with the Chinese leader at Trump's Florida retreat, Mar-a-Lago, seems to have changed the dynamic between them. 
  
 "President XI of China, who I think is a very good person, wants the best for his people," he says. "... I think he is a fantastic person. Now, maybe he won't do anything for the United States or maybe he will. But I think he is a very good person, and my opinion of that won't change. 
  
 "So when I met him at Mar-a-Lago, which is a dealmakers paradise, and we sat in that living room, in these big beautiful chairs, and we sat there, it was supposed to be a 10-minute one-on-one, then we go into a breakout room where we have 40 people — 40 people, you know, 40 each — and that was going to be the whole day." 
  
 Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Trump's Florida retreat, Mar-a-Lago, seems to have changed the dynamic between them. 
  
 But Trump recounts being told by Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the global private-equity firm Blackstone, "that President Xi is a great guy and, if you could, get to know him one-on-one [rather] than sitting in the big breakout room. 
  
 "So we sat for 10 minutes, but the 10 minutes turned out to be three hours." 
  
 The same thing happened the next day. "And, so, now we have a real relationship. I spoke to him again two days ago. He is a great guy. Now, with that being said, he is in love with China, and he is in love with the people of China. And that is a great thing. 
  
 "But I think he is going to try to help us with North Korea. Because he does not want to see us wanting to attack North Korea. And I think he would love to see if he could work something out." 
  
 Even so, the administration has been pressing the United Nations to enact more sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs, while U.S. military maneuvers are being conducted alongside South Korean forces near their capital, Seoul. 
  
 Amid all of the administration's dealings with the U.N., Trump says he likes "a lot" of world leaders. 
  
 "Well, believe it or not, I have a great relationship with [German] Chancellor Angela Merkel," he says, refuting reports that he refused to shake her hand during a meeting. "I shook hands with her four times before I sat down. ... We get along great." 
  
 The same is true, he says, of Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and of Britain's Theresa May: "I thought she was great." 
  
 As for Russia's Vladimir Putin, the source of so much trouble for his administration, he says simply that they haven't met yet. 
  
 Staying connected 
  
 Although foreign affairs have been a preoccupation, the one thing Trump insists he will not stop doing is staying connected to Americans, in particular, to those who voted for him. 
  
 "I love my people," he says. "They are the greatest people." 
  
 "That's the final map of the numbers — not bad, right?" the president says. "The red is us, the blue is Hillary. There is a lot of red." (Graeme Jennings/Washington Examiner) 
  
 And with that, he reaches across the Resolute Desk for a sheet of paper showing a map of the United States. It illustrates the latest figures from the 2016 electoral map, and it is covered in a sea of red ink. 
  
 "That's the final map of the numbers — not bad, right?" he says. "The red is us, the blue is Hillary. There is a lot of red." 
  
 How does that make him feel? He lingers over the map, takes a deep breath. 
  
 "Very, very honored. And proud. And I love the people of this country. These people are incredible people." 
  
 He is not worried about staying connected to them. 
  
 "I think I am doing that," he says, pointing as one example to the executive orders on protecting U.S.-made aluminum and steel that he signed in the past 10 days. 
  
 "And, you know, that is just a first step. You can't do what you want to do. You have to do the steps, you have to do the study, you have to review the study, you have to go through a process and then you have to do what you have to do." 
  
 Bringing back skilled and well-paid workers involved in manufacturing aluminum, steel, other goods? It's going to happen, he insists, and very soon. 
  
 "We have been tremendously mistreated by the world, with dumping" of foreign-made products, he insists. 
  
 But, he continues, "we have a great country, and it is turning around. And there has never been optimism like this before." 
  
 "Don't forget, I got him [Justice Neil Gorsuch] nominated and confirmed in those 100 days," Trump says. 
  
 He promises, as he did during the campaign, to get rid "of tremendous regulations," to help American companies compete more easily in the world market and to put more of America's citizens back to work. 
  
 That leads, naturally, to an assessment of his own work in his first 100 days, which is, predictably, that no president "has ever done what I have done" even though "the first-hundred-day standard is ridiculous." 
  
 "Well, I think that the Supreme Court is very important," he explains, "because every 5-to-4 decision is because of me. And that could go on for 40 years," since his first appointment to the court, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, "is a young man" at age 49. 
  
 "Don't forget, I got him nominated and confirmed in those 100 days," he adds, not willing to give up the 100-day argument quite yet. 
  
 What about longer-term, after four or even eight years of a Trump presidency? 
  
 "What I would like to do is peace. Have great strength for the country. And jobs." 
  
 As the interview ends, the room suddenly fills with White House officials once again: Vice President Mike Pence, who gives this reporter two big hugs; chief of staff Reince Priebus, who shakes hands warmly and chats happily about political trends and gossip; campaign manager and now presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, smiling broadly and offering an update on her children. 
  
 An atmosphere — friendly, happy, energetic — infuses the Oval Office, already glowing with afternoon sunlight. You find yourself wondering what the next discussion among these figures will be, how it might add to two centuries of history, sometimes good, sometimes terrifying, that has unfolded within these curved walls. 
  
 And you wonder, too, what keeps this president awake at night? 
  
 "Not much," he says, simply. "I don't sleep but, then again, I never did." ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

In this respect, Donald Trump is just like his predecessors. In an interview with Salena Zito for Sirius XM radio, Trump discussed the nastiness of the 2016 campaign. (Sirius released a clip; the full interview is to air Monday afternoon.) He was told that the 1828 race between John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson was the most similar, he said. "Had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later, you wouldn’t have had the Civil War" @realDonaldTrump told @SalenaZito. Full intv at 2pE, Ch124 pic.twitter.com/d7PuRRm7Md — SiriusXMPolitics (@SXMPolitics) May 1, 2017 “I said, ‘When was Andrew Jackson?’ It was 1828, that’s a long time ago, that was Andrew Jackson,�? Trump said, a sign that the history to follow would be somewhat shaky. Reminiscing about a visit to Tennessee in March, Trump continued: I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn’t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, “There’s no reason for this.�? People don’t realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why? People don’t ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out? As with so many things Trump says, the quotation is simultaneously deeply confusing, and yet also deeply revealing. 
  
 On an historical level, Trump’s remarks are full of problems. It is difficult to know what the president means when he says that Jackson “was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War.�? Jackson died in 1845, 16 years before the war began, though the challenge to national unity posed by slavery was clear by then. It’s possible Trump is referring to the Nullification Crisis, a conflict between the federal government and the state of South Carolina. The Palmetto State, outraged at high tariffs imposed by the federal government that aided industry but harmed slave states, announced it was “nullifying�? the tariff—refusing to pay it. (The idea that states can nullify federal law has been rejected by courts, but keeps popping up throughout American history.) Related Story Donald Trump's Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Jackson, though born in South Carolina and an advocate for states’ rights, took a hard line, getting authorization to use military force against the state to enforce the law, though a compromise tariff ended up resolving the crisis without armed conflict. But assuming that this type of strong leadership, leavened with compromise, would have staved off the Civil War is dubious, for reasons raised by the rest of Trump’s answer: “People don’t realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why? People don’t ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?�? 
  
 In fact, of course, many, many people do ask that question. (One might imagine that Trump, as a creature of Twitter, might be aware of the endless debates about the war in that platform.) What’s more, it is a question that has been definitively answered. The Civil War was fought over slavery, and the insistence of Southern states that they be allowed to keep it. (You needn’t take my word for it: Read the statements of the states that seceded, and their leaders, making the case.) It is difficult to imagine that Jackson, as a Southern slaveholder and defender of slavery, would have been willing to stand against the South in the event of a civil war. But that’s ultimately beside the point: Even if he had, such a position would likely have stood little chance of preventing the war, which flowed from the Southern commitment to slavery. Trump’s assertion that Jackson could have staved war off is a manifestation of Trump’s central, and perhaps only truly committed, political beliefs: a faith in the power of strength, and a faith in the power of dealmaking. It is why the president rushed to congratulate Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on a referendum empowering him and sapping democracy; it is why he is so fond of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi; and it is why on Sunday he invited the vicious Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to the White House. If only there had been an Andrew Jackson in the White House, rather than a James Buchanan, goes the thinking, the war could have been averted. ||||| President Donald Trump on Monday questioned why the Civil War occurred: “Why could that one not have been worked out?” 
  
 In an interview with Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito on SiriusXM show “Main Street Meets the Beltway,” Trump compared his campaign and election victory — now over for more than six months — to those of Andrew Jackson, an analogy Trump has courted since his inauguration. 
  
 “They said my campaign is most like, my campaign and win, was most like Andrew Jackson,” Trump said. “I said, ‘When was Andrew Jackson?’ It was 1828. That’s a long time ago.” 
  
 The comparison might be less apt than Trump would like. Before Jackson was elected president, he killed a man he accused of insulting his wife in a duel. 
  
 Trump appeared to praise Jackson, a slaveholder who was accused of slave trading and who owned approximately 150 people at the time of his death, as a “swashbuckler.” 
  
 “Had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn’t have had the Civil War,” Trump said. “He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart.” (Jackson engineered the deaths of thousands of Native Americans while he was in office.) 
  
 “He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, ‘There’s no reason for this,'” Trump continued. “People don’t realize, you know, the Civil War, you think about it, why? People don’t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?” 
  
 In fact, Jackson died in 1845, long before the Civil War began in 1861, when seven southern slave states seceded after President Abraham Lincoln won election on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery into the territories. A total of 11 states eventually formed the Confederate States of America. 
  
 Trump’s last unsuccessful foray into the history of slavery in the United States fell flat when he described 19th-century black abolitionist leader, social reformer and writer Frederick Douglass as “somebody who has done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more.” ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump makes a puzzling claim about Andrew Jackson and the Civil War in an interview. 
  
 Speaking to The Washington Examiner, Trump wonders why issues "could not have been worked out" in order to prevent the bloody conflict. Trump praises the accomplishments of Jackson, the populist president he has cited as a role model. 
  
 He makes the puzzling claim that Jackson "was really angry that he saw what was happening in regard to the Civil War." But Jackson died in 1845, and the Civil War didn't begin until 16 years later, in 1861. 
  
 Trump then says, "People don't ask the question, but why was there the Civil War?" 
  
 The war was decades in the making, stemming from disputes between the North and South about slavery and states' rights. |||||
