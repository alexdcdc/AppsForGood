The UK's longest-reigning monarch appears in a photograph taken by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz.
The image was taken when the Queen posed for three official pictures at Easter to mark her 90th birthday.
The Duke of Edinburgh also posed with the Queen, and their picture will appear in the magazine, out on Friday, as well as the three official images.
Sitting on a rug in the grounds of Windsor Castle, the Queen was photographed with her corgis, Willow and Holly, and dorgis, Candy and Vulcan.
Leibovitz told the fashion and popular culture magazine: "The most moving, important thing about this shoot is that these were all her ideas."
The Queen, who celebrates two birthdays each year, turned 90 on 21 April.
Her official birthday is celebrated with the Trooping the Colour at Horse Guards Parade on a Saturday in June - this year on 11 June.
Leibovitz  added: "I was told how relaxed she was at Windsor, and it was really true.
"You get the sense of how at peace she was with herself, and very much enthralled with her family."
