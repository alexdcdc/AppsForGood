Opener Adam Lyth made 88 and England batsman Joe Root scored 45 in Yorkshire's total of 256-9.
Kent's run-chase looked well set thanks to half-centuries from Darren Stevens (54) and Alex Blake (50).
But Liam Plunkett (4-52) and David Willey (3-34) helped book a semi-final place at home to Surrey on 28 August.
Yorkshire will also go for limited-overs honours in the T20 Blast when they face Durham in the semi-final at Edgbaston on Saturday, and are second in the County Championship as they try to win a third straight title.
Despite reaching the last eight of the competition for a third successive year, Kent will focus the remainder of their season on the Division Two promotion race.
Yorkshire were packed with international experience for the visit to Canterbury with Root, Gary Ballance and Jonny Bairstow all included following the conclusion of England's Test series against Pakistan.
It was former Test opener Lyth who set a platform for their innings, with Root in support during a second-wicket stand of 90 runs.
But, Bairstow (9) and Ballance (37) found the going tough as Kent put on the squeeze with two wickets each for seamers Charlie Hartley and Will Gidman.
Adil Rashid (24 not out), who will be part of England's ODI squad for the forthcoming series against Pakistan, found some late boundaries to push his side above 250.
Kent's reply was in disarray at 66-4 before Blake and Stevens mounted a fightback with a fifth-wicket partnership of 86.
Blake was dismissed two balls after reaching his 36-ball half-century and Stevens' 500th appearance for the county was spectacularly ended by an acrobatic return catch from Plunkett.
Matt Coles launched Azeem Rafiq for 16 runs in three successive balls, but his departure to a sharp Bairstow stumping off Rashid left final pair James Tredwell and Mitchell Claydon requiring 16 from 18 balls.
Tredwell was trapped leg before to Willey as Yorkshire secured victory with 11 balls to spare.
